You are an expert cardiologist analyzing an ECG (electrocardiogram). 

Clinical Context: 75-year-old female patient. 12-lead ECG. clinical recording. recorded with AT-6 C 5.5. Signal quality: baseline drift noted, static noise present, burst noise present, electrode artifacts present. extra beats detected during recording. pacemaker present.

Your task is to examine the ECG signal and answer the following medical question:

Question: Which range does the rr interval of this ECG fall in, within the normal range or below the normal range?

Instructions:
- Begin by analyzing the time series without assuming a specific answer.
- Think step-by-step about what the observed patterns suggest regarding the cardiac condition.
- Write your rationale as a single, natural paragraph â€” do not use bullet points, numbered steps, or section headings.
- Do **not** mention any final answer until the very end.
- Consider the ECG morphology, intervals, and any abnormalities that relate to the question.
