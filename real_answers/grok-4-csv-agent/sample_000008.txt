The ECG tracing from this 55-year-old male patient with a pacemaker reveals a paced rhythm, as evidenced by the wide and abnormal QRS morphology in the initial 0.11 seconds of the recording, with prominent positive deflections in the precordial leads, particularly V4 to V6, where amplitudes reach substantial levels such as 2.883 mV in V6, consistent with ventricular pacing. The limb leads display initial negative voltages, like -0.501 mV in lead II, transitioning to positive peaks, but without deep or prolonged initial negatives that would qualify as pathologic Q waves in most leads, as the negative durations are brief (around 0.03 seconds) and depths are not exceeding one-quarter of the subsequent R wave height in key areas. In the precordial leads, the complexes show complex patterns with mixed positive and negative components, but no clear initial Q waves in V3 to V6, suggesting no established necrotic changes yet. Notably, at the termination of the QRS complex around 0.11 seconds, the signal does not return to baseline in several precordial leads, remaining elevated at 0.299 mV in V3, 0.501 mV in V4, 0.738 mV in V5, and 0.940 mV in V6, which translates to significant ST segment elevation (over 5 mm in V4-V6 assuming standard calibration), while reciprocal mild depressions appear in the limb leads like -0.140 mV in I and II, a pattern indicative of acute ischemia in the anterolateral region. The presence of a pacemaker complicates interpretation, but the concordant ST elevation in leads with positive QRS (V4-V6) meets criteria for acute injury even in paced rhythms, and the lack of T wave inversions in the provided segment (as the signal flattens abruptly afterward, possibly due to data presentation) further supports that the process has not progressed to the evolving phase where repolarization abnormalities deepen. Signal artifacts, baseline drift, static, burst noise, and electrode issues noted in the clinical context may introduce some variability, but the contiguous lead involvement and absence of chronic markers like persistent Q waves or resolved ST changes point to an ongoing injury pattern rather than a healed or subacute state. The stage of infarction is acute.
