The ECG signal begins with a brief period of irregular, high-amplitude fluctuations across all leads in the first 0.11 seconds, featuring abrupt swings such as from approximately 0.1 mV to -1.7 mV in lead I over a single 0.01-second interval, and peak values reaching as low as -2.7 mV in V6, which far exceed typical physiological QRS amplitudes and exhibit slew rates inconsistent with normal cardiac depolarization or repolarization patterns like organized P waves, narrow QRS complexes, or smooth T waves; these rapid, erratic deflections lack the periodicity expected in a standard sinus rhythm or even in the presence of a pacemaker with potential paced beats or extrasystoles, instead resembling non-biological interference, and following this short segment, the signal flatlines at zero across all leads for the remaining duration, which could suggest lead disconnection or severe artifact suppression but, when combined with the initial chaotic activity, aligns more closely with transient electrical disturbances rather than true cardiac pathology, although the overall absence of ongoing waveforms raises concerns for asystole or recording failure, yet the localized nature of the high-variance segment in an otherwise quiescent trace points strongly to an isolated artifactual event amid noted signal quality issues including baseline drift and electrode problems.
