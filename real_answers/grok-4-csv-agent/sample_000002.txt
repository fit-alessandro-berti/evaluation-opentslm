The ECG recording from this 85-year-old female patient presents a 12-lead setup with noted signal quality issues such as baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which can distort wave morphologies and make precise measurements challenging, while the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats suggests a potentially paced rhythm or arrhythmias that could affect atrial depolarization patterns. Examining the time series data at 100 Hz over the 10-second duration, the leads like II, aVL, and V1 are key for assessing P waves, as they often provide the clearest view of atrial activity, and in the initial segment of the data where non-zero values are present, the voltage in lead II shows an initial negative deflection followed by positive rises and subsequent oscillations before a sharp rise at 0.07 seconds likely marking the QRS complex onset. These fluctuations in the early timeframe from 0.00 to 0.06 seconds appear to represent the P wave, with the onset identified as the departure from the isoelectric baseline around 0.00 seconds and the offset where it returns near 0.06 seconds prior to the QRS, spanning about 60 ms, though the noisy, oscillating pattern with multiple peaks and troughs could indicate a notched P wave commonly seen in atrial enlargement or conduction delays, potentially extending the perceived duration if considering the full extent of atrial activation amidst the artifacts. The pacemaker may contribute to altered P wave shapes if atrial pacing is involved, but in the visible beats, no obvious pacing spikes dominate the atrial portion, and the extra beats noted in the clinical context might introduce variability, yet averaging the observable P wave intervals after accounting for noise suggests no marked prolongation. The overall morphology, including any irregularities in intervals due to extrasystoles, does not show definitive evidence of abnormal atrial conduction times beyond standard limits, aligning with typical findings in an elderly patient unless further signal processing reveals otherwise.
