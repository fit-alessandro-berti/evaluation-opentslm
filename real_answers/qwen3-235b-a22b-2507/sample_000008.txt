The ECG presents significant challenges in interpretation due to multiple technical issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, all of which degrade signal quality. Additionally, the presence of a pacemaker alters the expected morphology of the QRS complexes, complicating the assessment of intrinsic cardiac electrical activity. The recording shows variable amplitude and morphology in the early seconds (0–0.10 s), suggesting possible intrinsic rhythm, but from approximately 0.12 s onward, all leads display a flatline at 0.00000 mV for the remaining duration of the 10-second strip. This prolonged isoelectric line could represent either a true electrical silence (such as in asystole), a lead disconnection, or a technical artifact—such as signal loss, calibration error, or pacemaker oversensing leading to inappropriate inhibition of pacing. Given that the signal drops abruptly to zero across all leads simultaneously and remains flat without any deflections (including paced spikes), technical failure or lead detachment is more likely than a true biological event. In the context of an ongoing clinical recording, such a finding would necessitate immediate technical reassessment to rule out equipment malfunction. Because there are no discernible ST-segment elevations, T-wave inversions, Q waves, or other evolving changes beyond the initial few seconds, and given that the majority of the tracing is uninterpretable due to signal loss, it is impossible to assess for features of acute, evolving, or old myocardial infarction. No morphological criteria for any stage of infarction—hyperacute, acute, subacute, or chronic—can be reliably evaluated. Therefore, no definitive determination regarding the stage of infarction can be made. The stage of infarction cannot be determined.
