The ECG signal presents significant challenges for accurate interpretation due to multiple technical artifacts, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which obscure the underlying cardiac electrical activity. Moreover, there are extra beats noted during the recording, and a pacemaker is present, further complicating the morphology assessment. Upon reviewing the 12-lead ECG data over the full 10-second window at 100 Hz sampling rate, no distinct P waves can be definitively identified. The leads that typically show clear atrial activity (such as II and V1) lack consistent, identifiable positive or biphasic deflections corresponding to atrial depolarization. The presence of a pacemaker may result in atrial pacing, which could produce small or obscured P waves, or the patient may have atrial fibrillation or atrophy, particularly at this advanced age (85 years), leading to absent or indiscernible P waves. Given the noise, signal saturation (many values are zero or flatlined after initial time points), and lack of visible P waves across all leads, it is not possible to measure the P wave duration with confidence. Without a measurable P wave onset and offset, determining whether the P duration falls within the normal range (typically 80â€“120 ms) or is prolonged cannot be reliably performed. Therefore, despite the clinical context, the signal quality and absence of visible P wave morphology preclude accurate assessment.

The P duration cannot be determined due to unmeasurable P waves caused by poor signal quality and underlying technical artifacts; thus, it is not possible to classify it as within or above the normal range.
