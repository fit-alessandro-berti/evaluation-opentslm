The ECG trace shows a baseline characterized by prolonged isoelectric lines with minimal fluctuation after the initial few milliseconds, particularly from 0.13 seconds onward, where all leads consistently display a flat line at 0.00000 mV across the entire duration until 10 seconds. The only deflection observed occurs in the first 100 milliseconds (0.00 to approximately 0.12 seconds), showing a series of waveforms resembling a single sinus-conducted beat, including identifiable P wave, QRS complex, and T wave morphology in lead II and corresponding leads. However, no additional spontaneous beats are observed in the remaining 9.9 seconds of recording. The clinical note indicates "extra beats detected during recording," yet the digitized signal fails to show any such additional depolarizations. Furthermore, the presence of a pacemaker is indicated, which could suppress intrinsic rhythm and generate paced beats; however, no pacemaker spikes or paced events are discernible in the waveform. Given the absence of any premature or ectopic beats with consistent morphology, particularly absent early P waves with altered morphology or PR intervals followed by narrow QRS complexes—hallmarks of supraventricular extrasystoles—there is no electrocardiographic evidence of supraventricular extrasystoles in this sampled data. The lack of any visible additional beats, combined with the flat baseline suggesting possible technical artifact, signal loss, or recording error (amplified by noted noise and artifacts), limits the interpretability of rhythm analysis. Therefore, despite the clinical flag of extra beats, the ECG data provided do not demonstrate supraventricular extrasystoles.  

No.
