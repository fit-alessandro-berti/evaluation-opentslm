The ECG tracing exhibits significant technical artifacts that severely limit interpretation, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, all of which degrade signal quality. Notably, from 0.12 to 2.57 seconds and again from approximately 4.00 to 10.00 seconds, all leads show a flat line with values consistently recorded as zero, suggesting possible lead disconnection, signal loss, or equipment malfunction. The only apparent non-flat segment occurs between approximately 0.00 and 0.12 seconds (and partially up to 0.19 seconds in some leads), where brief deflections are visible—most notably a sharp positive deflection around 0.02 seconds in lead I and its corresponding leads—potentially representing a single paced ventricular event. The presence of a pacemaker is noted in the clinical data, and the morphology of this deflection (sharp rise, high amplitude, narrow) is consistent with a pacing spike followed by a paced QRS complex. However, due to the extremely limited duration of interpretable signal and widespread signal dropout, assessment of underlying rhythm, P waves, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, axis, or any other diagnostic features is not feasible. The persistent flatline across most of the recording raises concern for either a profound sensing failure, complete loss of cardiac electrical activity (asystole), or, more likely, a technical recording error. Given the context, the most reasonable interpretation is that the ECG is non-diagnostic due to technical failure. 

Diagnostic symptoms: pacemaker present, non-diagnostic ECG, signal loss/artifact.  
Uncertain symptoms: ineffective pacing, asystole (cannot be confirmed due to technical limitations).
