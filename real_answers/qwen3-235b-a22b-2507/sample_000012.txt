The ECG trace shows multiple technical artifacts, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which significantly degrade signal quality and challenge accurate waveform measurement. The presence of a pacemaker further complicates interpretation, as paced rhythms can intrinsically produce wide QRS complexes due to non-physiological ventricular activation. However, in the available data, the majority of the signal from 0.00 to 9.99 seconds is suppressed or flatlined, with all lead values remaining at 0.00000 mV after the initial seconds, suggesting potential signal loss, saturation, or recording artifact. The only notable deflections occur between approximately 0.01 and 0.12 seconds, where there appears to be a narrow QRS complex; in lead II, the QRS seems to span from about 0.01 s to 0.04 s, giving a duration of roughly 30 milliseconds. This duration is well within the normal range (typically < 110â€“120 ms). However, the extremely poor signal quality, lack of sustained readable waveform, and potential pacemaker influence limit confidence in a definitive measurement across the entire strip. Additionally, the flatlined data may indicate the recording captured only paced events or technical failure rather than intrinsic cardiac activity. Despite these limitations, the only measurable QRS interval in the readable portion is narrow and normal in duration.
