The ECG signal shows multiple significant artifacts and technical issues that severely compromise interpretation. Baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts are present, which distort the waveform morphology and make accurate assessment of cardiac electrical activity unreliable. Additionally, extra beats are detected, but their nature cannot be confidently determined due to the overwhelming noise. A pacemaker is noted, yet the presence of pacing spikes and capture cannot be confirmed because the signal is dominated by artifact and flatlines after the initial 0.11 seconds. From 0.12 seconds onward, all leads register zero values, indicating either signal loss, lead disconnection, or device malfunction. Given that the majority of the recording is isoelectric with no discernible P-waves, QRS complexes, or T-waves, effective rhythm and interval analysis is impossible. Therefore, no reliable form-related abnormalities can be identified due to the non-diagnostic quality of the tracing.
