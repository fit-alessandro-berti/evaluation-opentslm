The ECG demonstrates a significant amount of noise and artifact, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which severely degrade the signal quality and limit diagnostic interpretation. Additionally, the presence of a pacemaker alters the expected morphology of the QRS complexes, and extra beats are noted, further complicating analysis. Despite these challenges, the most notable observation is the absence of any clear ST-segment elevations, pathological Q waves, or other classic morphological changes typically associated with acute or prior myocardial infarction across the 12 leads. While conduction disturbances could theoretically be present—especially in the context of paced rhythm—the extreme noise and flatline appearance of large portions of the tracing from 0.15 seconds onward (where all leads drop to and remain at 0.00000 mV) suggest technical failure or corrupted data rather than physiological conduction abnormalities. This prolonged isoelectric line with no discernible P-waves, QRS complexes, or T-waves after the initial few milliseconds raises serious concern about signal acquisition integrity, making it impossible to definitively assess for conduction disturbances such as bundle branch blocks or AV nodal delays. In the absence of identifiable cardiac electrical activity beyond the first few sampled points, and given that there are no features diagnostic of myocardial infarction, the limitations imposed by signal quality preclude reliable detection of either condition, but the data do not support the presence of myocardial infarction based on standard ECG criteria.
