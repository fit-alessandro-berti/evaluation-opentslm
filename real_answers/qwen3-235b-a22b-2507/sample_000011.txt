The ECG trace exhibits significant technical artifacts, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which severely degrade signal quality and impair accurate interpretation. Additionally, extra beats and the presence of a pacemaker further complicate analysis. Despite these limitations, assessment of the cardiac axis relies on the net direction of ventricular depolarization in the frontal plane, typically evaluated through leads I, II, and III. However, in this recording, the majority of the waveform data is flatlined or near-zero after the initial few seconds, with only brief deflections between 0.00 and 0.08 seconds followed by prolonged isoelectric segments. The absence of discernible QRS complexes beyond the earliest portion of the recording, combined with the poor signal quality, makes reliable determination of the axis impossible. Without clear, interpretable waveforms in the limb leads—particularly the relative amplitudes and directions of QRS complexes in leads I and aVF—identifying whether the axis falls within normal limits or demonstrates extreme deviation cannot be confidently performed. Therefore, due to overwhelming noise and signal loss, the cardiac axis cannot be reliably assessed. The final answer is that the ECG does not provide sufficient diagnostic quality to determine the cardiac axis. **extreme axis deviation**.
