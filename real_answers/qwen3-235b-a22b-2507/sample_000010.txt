The ECG demonstrates clear evidence of multiple types of noise as specified in the clinical context. At the beginning of the recording (approximately 0 to 0.28 seconds), there is a visible abrupt shift in baseline across all leads, characterized by rapid fluctuations and non-physiological deflections inconsistent with typical cardiac depolarization patternsâ€”this is indicative of **static noise** and possibly **burst noise**. Following this, from approximately 0.3 to 1.0 seconds, the signal drops abruptly to a value of 0.0 in all 12 leads and remains flat for the remainder of the 10-second trace. This complete absence of any electrical signal after 0.3 seconds strongly suggests a **signal loss** or **electrode detachment**, which is corroborated by the reported "electrode artifacts" and "baseline drift" in the signal quality assessment. The flat line does not represent asystole, especially given the presence of pacemaker, but rather a technical failure in signal acquisition. The baseline drift is evident in the unstable zero point and transient signal deviation at the start. Therefore, despite the initial brief capture of cardiac activity, the ECG is severely compromised by noise and technical artifacts.
