The ECG recording is severely compromised by multiple technical artifacts including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which significantly degrade signal fidelity. The presence of a noted pacemaker is important context but does not assist in assessing for chronic ischemic changes without interpretable intrinsic cardiac electrical activity. Examination of the waveform morphology reveals a marked lack of identifiable cardiac deflectionsâ€”specifically, no clear P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves can be discerned across any of the 12 leads after the first 0.03 seconds. The entire trace is essentially flat from 0.12 seconds onward, and even the early portion of the trace lacks the characteristic progression of a normal or abnormal cardiac cycle that would be expected in a valid ECG. Given that diagnostic assessment for an old myocardial infarction relies on identifying persistent ECG changes such as pathological Q waves, ST segment shifts, or well-defined abnormal T wave inversions in relevant leads, the absence of interpretable waveforms precludes any meaningful analysis. There are no detectable Q waves or other morphological signs of prior infarction, but this is due to the lack of viable data rather than true preservation of myocardial tissue. The recording fails to meet minimum technical standards for clinical interpretation, making it impossible to either confirm or exclude a previous myocardial infarction.
