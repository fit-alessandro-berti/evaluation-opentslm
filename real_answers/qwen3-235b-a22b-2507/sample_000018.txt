The evaluation of the ECG reveals significant technical artifacts across all leads, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which severely compromise signal quality and limit reliable interpretation of waveform morphology. The presence of a pacemaker further complicates assessment, as paced rhythms can inherently alter depolarization and repolarization patterns, potentially masking or mimicking T-wave abnormalities. Non-diagnostic T-wave abnormalities typically refer to T waves that cannot be reliably interpreted due to poor signal quality, interfering waveforms, or artifact that obscures the ST segment and T-wave morphology. In this recording, the signal appears flatlined or saturated at or near zero across all leads for the majority of the 10-second duration, with only brief, isolated deflections observed early in the trace (e.g., around 0.03â€“0.12 seconds) that may represent paced or intrinsic cardiac events but are quickly lost in noise. Given the absence of discernible T waves and the overwhelming noise and artifact, no lead provides a reliable assessment of repolarization. Therefore, the T-wave activity cannot be meaningfully interpreted in any lead.

Leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are all showing symptoms of non-diagnostic T abnormalities.
