In analyzing this ECG recording for an 80-year-old female with a pacemaker, significant signal quality issues are immediately apparent, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which limit the reliability of waveform interpretation. However, the non-zero segment (0.00 to 0.11 seconds) must be assessed for cardiac axis determination, as the remainder of the recording (0.12 to 10.00 seconds) is entirely flatlined at 0.00000 mV across all leads, likely reflecting technical failure or disconnection rather than physiological quiescence. During the active portion, the QRS complex appears fragmented and irregular due to noise, but key limb leads show discernible deflections. Lead I demonstrates a net positive QRS deflection (summed voltage ≈ +1.19682) when integrating values from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, while lead aVF also shows a net positive deflection (summed voltage ≈ +1.61215), with both leads exhibiting dominant upward vectors during the primary R-wave peaks at 0.07 seconds (I: +0.83094, aVF: +1.02855). This pattern—positive in both lead I and aVF—places the electrical axis within the normal quadrant (0° to +90°), consistent with standard axis determination methodology using the quadrant approach. Although the pacemaker and "extra beats" noted in the clinical context could theoretically cause axis deviation (e.g., right axis deviation in ventricular pacing), the observed morphology does not support extreme axis deviation (defined as <-90° or >+180°), which would require negative QRS complexes in both leads I and aVF. The fragmented waveform may suggest pacing or artifact interference, but the net positivity in these critical leads overrides concern for aberrant conduction, and the absence of consistent negative deflections rules out northwest axis. Given the data constraints and the physiological expectation of normal axis in paced rhythms with preserved conduction, the evidence aligns with a normal cardiac axis despite the recording limitations.

The ECG shows a normal heart axis.
