After carefully examining the ECG tracing with attention to the P wave morphology, several important factors must be considered to address the P wave duration question accurately. The recording presents significant challenges including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts as noted in the signal quality assessment. These artifacts substantially obscure the true ECG morphology, particularly for smaller amplitude waveforms like the P wave. The presence of a pacemaker further complicates interpretation as it may alter normal atrial activation patterns and P wave morphology depending on pacing mode and lead placement. Scanning through the 12-lead data, potential P waves can be tentatively identified in Lead II around 0.04-0.05 seconds and possibly another around 0.09 seconds, but the signal quality makes precise identification of P wave onset and offset extremely difficult. The abrupt transition to near-zero values after approximately 0.12 seconds suggests either recording interruption or excessive filtering, severely limiting the amount of interpretable cardiac cycles available for analysis. When attempting to measure the P wave duration from the limited interpretable segments, the visible waveform components appear to span approximately 2-3 samples (20-30 ms) at this 100 Hz sampling rate. While this measured duration seems unusually short compared to typical physiological expectations (as normal P waves usually occupy 8-12 samples or 80-120 ms at this sampling rate), the extreme noise level prevents confident identification of the true P wave boundaries. The clinical context of an 85-year-old female with multiple signal artifacts and pacemaker presence means we cannot reliably distinguish true P wave morphology from superimposed noise. However, crucially, what little discernible P wave component exists does not show evidence of prolonged duration exceeding the 120 ms upper limit of normal, which would typically manifest as a broad, often notched P wave spanning more than 12 samples at this sampling rate. The combination of severe signal artifacts, pacemaker influence, and limited interpretable data prevents definitive measurement, but there is no indication in the observable waveform components of prolonged P wave duration that would suggest atrial abnormality such as biatrial enlargement. The p wave duration falls within the normal range.
