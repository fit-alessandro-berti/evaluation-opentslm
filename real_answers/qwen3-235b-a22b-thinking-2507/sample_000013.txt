The ECG presented exhibits extremely poor signal quality throughout the majority of the recording, with nearly all leads reverting to a flatline (0.00000 mV) after the initial 0.12 seconds—despite the 10-second duration specified. Notably, the first 0.12 seconds show transient waveforms, but the abrupt transition to universal baseline noiselessness (flatline) suggests either technical failure, severe artifact, or calibration issues rather than physiological cardiac activity, as no discernible cardiac cycles (P waves, QRS complexes, T waves) are sustained beyond this point. Pathological Q waves, the hallmark ECG finding for old myocardial infarction, require consistent, well-defined positive and negative deflections across multiple cardiac cycles in relevant leads to assess for abnormal depolarization patterns (e.g., Q waves ≥40 ms duration or ≥25% of R wave amplitude). Here, the absence of interpretable QRS complexes beyond the earliest fragmentary data—coupled with the presence of a pacemaker (which inherently alters QRS morphology through ventricular pacing, mimicking or obscuring infarction patterns) and the documented signal integrity issues (baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts)—precludes any reliable evaluation of Q wave presence or morphology. Additionally, pacemaker rhythms often produce left or right bundle branch block patterns, further complicating the identification of true pathological Q waves. The reported extra beats do not resolve these fundamental interpretive barriers, as no stable underlying rhythm or consistent waveforms exist for comparison. Given the complete lack of analyzable cardiac electrical activity across almost the entire recording, no conclusions can be drawn about prior myocardial infarction with confidence. The signal is non-diagnostic. No.
