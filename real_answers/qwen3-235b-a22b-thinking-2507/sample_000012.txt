Analyzing the ECG data provided for a 32-year-old male with a pacemaker, the recording exhibits significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the detection of extra beats, which collectively impair interpretation. The data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, shows non-zero values only from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds before truncating to a persistent zero baseline from 0.12 to 10.00 seconds—a feature not physiologically plausible in a living patient and likely reflecting severe recording artifacts or device-related issues, despite the clinical notation of "extra beats detected." Focusing on the non-zero segment, the initial fluctuations in leads such as II and aVL show early deviation from baseline around 0.01 seconds, with prominent negative deflections peaking around 0.02 seconds (e.g., lead II at -1.06137) followed by rapid positive transitions (e.g., lead II at 1.80604 at 0.04 seconds). The QRS duration, measured from the earliest deviation (approximately 0.01 seconds) to the point where the waveform begins declining from its peak (approximately 0.04 seconds) to avoid incorporating noisy ST segment or artifact-induced fluctuations, yields a duration of about 30 milliseconds. This duration is substantially below the typical lower limit of normal (which is approximately 80 milliseconds in adults), as ventricular depolarization cannot physiologically occur in under 60 milliseconds due to intrinsic conduction constraints across the myocardium. The implausibly short measurement is likely an artifact of the truncated signal quality (e.g., cutoff at 0.12 seconds) and the presence of noise disrupting waveform definition, rather than a true clinical finding. While ventricular pacing from the pacemaker would typically widen the QRS complex beyond 120 milliseconds, the observed fragment does not display the expected broad, slurred morphology. The data's inability to capture complete cardiac cycles—despite the reported extra beats—and the flatline truncation prevent reliable assessment of most QRS complexes, but the solitary measurable segment, however unreliable, falls well under the 120-millisecond upper normal limit.
