Upon examining the provided 10-second 12-lead ECG from the 87-year-old female with a documented pacemaker, initial analysis reveals a single cardiac complex spanning approximately 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, showing a negative deflection followed by a positive peak around 0.03 seconds and partial return toward baseline, suggesting a QRS complex with a duration of about 100 ms—borderline prolonged but potentially attributable to age or paced rhythm, though no distinct pacemaker spikes are visible in the noisy initial segment. Notably, from 0.12 seconds onward for the remaining 9.88 seconds, all leads abruptly transition to and maintain a completely flat isoelectric line at exactly zero amplitude, exceeding typical baseline drift or noise artifacts due to its absolute uniformity and persistence. While signal quality issues (baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, electrode artifacts) and the clinical note of "extra beats detected" complicate interpretation, this prolonged flat line—despite the expected pacemaker activity generating regular spikes or captured beats—cannot be reconciled with physiological rhythm and must be interpreted as indicative of ventricular asystole, a critical arrhythmia reflecting the absence of coordinated cardiac electrical activity. Although lead disconnection remains a technical possibility given the signal quality annotations, the ECG recording itself depicts this profound rhythm disturbance as a primary abnormality, overshadowing any assessment of potential extra beats in the uninterpretable zero-amplitude segment. Yes.
