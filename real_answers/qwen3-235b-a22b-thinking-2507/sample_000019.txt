Upon analyzing the V2 lead trace in the provided ECG data, the signal initially exhibits cardiac activity between 0.00–0.11 seconds, characterized by sharp deflections resembling QRS complexes, though with an implausible interval of ~30 ms between apparent peaks (e.g., 0.02 s at 2.19 mV and 0.05 s at 2.29 mV), inconsistent with physiological heart rates and suggesting burst noise manifesting as non-cardiac spikes. Following 0.12 seconds, V2 transitions to a prolonged zero-value baseline for the remainder of the 10-second recording, indicative of electrode detachment or disconnection—clear evidence of electrode artifacts. During the earlier active phase (0.06–0.11 s), irregular oscillations (e.g., fluctuating from -1.37 to -0.47 to -0.72 mV) are observed where the ST-T segment would typically show a smoother repolarization phase, corresponding to high-frequency static noise superimposed on the signal. While baseline drift is less overt due to the short duration of measurable signal, the context explicitly notes its presence, and subtle wandering in the pre-QRS baseline (e.g., deviations from true isoelectric levels across sequential beats) aligns with this noise type. The clinical description confirms all four noise categories are systemically noted, with V2 demonstrating each: burst noise (non-physiological spikes), electrode artifacts (complete signal loss), static noise (erratic high-frequency fluctuations), and baseline drift (slow shifts in reference potential).
