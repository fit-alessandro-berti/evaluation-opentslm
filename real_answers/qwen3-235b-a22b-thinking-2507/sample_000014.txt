Upon initial examination of the provided 10-second 12-lead ECG recording from the 72-year-old male with a pacemaker, significant technical limitations immediately impede interpretation. The signal demonstrates pervasive baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, but more critically, the waveform data collapses to absolute zero (0.00000) across all leads from 0.12 seconds onward for the vast majority of the recording duration, forming an unphysiological flatline uncharacteristic of cardiac activity even in paced rhythms. While brief non-zero values appear between 0.00–0.11 seconds (e.g., ST-T wave abnormalities at 0.06s with abrupt voltage spikes in inferolateral leads V4–V6), these fragments are corrupted by noise and electrode artifacts, preventing reliable assessment of morphology. A pacemaker is noted, yet no discernible pacemaker spikes precede QRS complexes, and the absence of any cardiac electrical activity beyond 0.11s contradicts expected paced rhythm continuity in a living patient. Crucially, evaluation of ST-segment deviation—required to distinguish inferior MI (ST elevation in II, III, aVF) from subendocardial injury (ST depression in inferolateral leads II, III, aVF, V5–V6)—is impossible due to signal truncation; no measurable ST segments exist after the initial 110ms, and early fragments are too degraded for analysis. The reported "extra beats" cannot be verified amid the noise, and the persistent flatline suggests data transmission failure rather than true asystole. Consequently, no diagnostic features of myocardial infarction or subendocardial injury can be assessed due to non-diagnostic signal quality.  

The ECG is non-interpretable due to critical signal degradation, rendering uncertain symptoms the only applicable classification.
