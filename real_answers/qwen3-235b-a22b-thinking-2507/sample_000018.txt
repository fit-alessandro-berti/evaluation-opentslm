Upon examining the provided 10-second 12-lead ECG recording from the 73-year-old male patient with a pacemaker, significant signal quality issues are immediately evident, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts as noted in the clinical context. The time-series data reveals that only the initial 0.12 seconds (from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds) contain any measurable electrical activity across all leads, with prominent deflections including a large positive wave at 0.03 seconds (likely representing a QRS complex) and another at 0.09 seconds. However, after 0.12 seconds, the recording flatlines completely to zero for all leads for the remainder of the 10-second duration. This abrupt and sustained flatline indicates a catastrophic signal loss, most consistent with electrode detachment or a technical malfunction, rather than physiological activity. Given that the T wave typically follows the QRS complex by 200–400 milliseconds in normal sinus rhythm (or paced rhythm), the absence of any signal beyond 0.12 seconds means the ST segment and T wave are entirely absent from the tracing. For instance, the R wave at approximately 0.03 seconds would normally be followed by a T wave around 0.23–0.43 seconds, but this segment is missing. Consequently, no lead captures the ST-T segment adequately for interpretation. The presence of a pacemaker might alter repolarization patterns, but without visible T-wave morphology, it is impossible to assess for abnormalities such as inversion, flattening, or elevation. The documented signal quality issues—particularly the complete electrode artifacts causing the flatline—directly prevent T-wave evaluation. Therefore, all leads, lacking interpretable T-wave activity due to signal discontinuity, are non-diagnostic for T-wave abnormalities. I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.
