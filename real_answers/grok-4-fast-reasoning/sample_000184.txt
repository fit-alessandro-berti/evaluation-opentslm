Examining the provided ECG time series data for lead aVR reveals a pattern of irregular and erratic voltage fluctuations over the initial 0.11 seconds, with values ranging from approximately -1.03 to +2.13 (assuming normalized units typical for ECG recordings), including abrupt shifts such as a sharp positive peak at 0.09 seconds and negative deflections around 0.02 and 0.05 seconds that lack the consistent morphology expected in cardiac waveforms like P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves. These variations do not align with the rhythmic intervals of a normal or paced cardiac cycle, particularly in a 79-year-old patient with a pacemaker, where one might anticipate more regular spikes or paced rhythms rather than such disjointed, high-amplitude changes; instead, the irregularity suggests non-physiological interference, compounded by the abrupt transition to a flatline at 0.12 seconds and beyond, which could indicate recording failure but does not negate the noisy initial segment. The overall lack of discernible ECG morphology, combined with the clinical note of poor signal quality including static noise, points to artifactual disruption rather than true cardiac activity in this lead. Therefore, yes, this ECG shows static noise in lead aVR.
