The ECG time series reveals initial fluctuating voltages across all leads in the first 0.11 seconds, with amplitudes ranging from approximately -1.03 mV to +0.76 mV, showing some irregular patterns that could represent brief cardiac activity, noise, or artifacts in the context of a pacemaker and extra beats, but these are followed by an immediate and complete cessation of signal from 0.12 seconds to the end of the 10-second recording, where every lead remains at precisely 0.00000 mV without any variation. This uniform flatline across the entire 12-lead setup is highly abnormal, as physiological ECGs should exhibit ongoing rhythmic deflections from atrial and ventricular depolarization, even with a pacemaker, and the sudden drop to zero without recovery suggests a technical failure rather than a cardiac standstill. Given the reported signal quality issues including electrode artifacts, this pattern is characteristic of electrode detachment, loose connections, or impedance problems disrupting contact with the skin, preventing further signal transmission while the baseline stabilizes at zero due to the amplifier's reference. Such artifacts compromise the reliability of the tracing for diagnostic purposes, directly indicating electrode problems.
