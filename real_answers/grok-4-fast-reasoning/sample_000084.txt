The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals a brief initial segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds with highly irregular voltage amplitudes across multiple leads, including sharp deflections such as I and II dropping from 0.08 mV to -0.93 mV and then to -2.16 mV within 0.02 seconds, while precordial leads like V4 swing from 3.54 mV to 1.51 mV to -3.08 mV to -5.58 mV in rapid succession, and V5 and V6 exhibit even more extreme oscillations up to 6.79 mV and down to -6.29 mV. These abrupt, high-magnitude changes over very short intervals suggest sudden disruptive interference rather than gradual shifts, as the patterns lack the slow, undulating baseline wander typical of respiratory or motion-induced drift, and instead resemble isolated spikes that could obscure P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves if physiological signal were present. The subsequent flatline at 0.00 mV from 0.12 seconds onward across all leads indicates a loss of signal acquisition, possibly from electrode issues or recording error, but does not align with ongoing baseline drift, which would show persistent low-frequency variations rather than complete cessation. Given the pacemaker presence and detected extra beats, some irregularity might stem from pacing artifacts, yet the morphology's volatile nature in the active portion points to acute, intermittent disruptions affecting interval measurements and overall interpretability, consistent with burst noise as the primary observed artifact in this recording.
