The provided ECG data exhibits significant quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a predominantly flatline signal after the initial 0.12 seconds, with only a brief segment of non-zero activity that displays irregular, high-amplitude deflections across multiple leads suggestive of pacemaker spikes, extra beats, or motion artifacts rather than a coherent cardiac cycle; in lead II, for instance, the early positive deflections at 0.00-0.04 seconds followed by negative shifts and abrupt positives around 0.06-0.08 seconds do not form a discernible QRS-T complex suitable for interval measurement, as the morphology lacks typical P-QRS-T progression and the sampling at 100 Hz over just 10 seconds yields insufficient beats for rate correction. The presence of a pacemaker further complicates interpretation, as paced rhythms can alter repolarization, but without identifiable Q waves or T wave endpoints amid the noise, the QT interval cannot be accurately quantified; normal QTc for a 52-year-old female is approximately 360-460 ms depending on heart rate, but the artifactual nature and incomplete signal prevent confirmation of prolongation, implying no evidence of an elevated QT interval.
