Upon examining the provided ECG time series data sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the recording reveals a brief period of activity from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds with fluctuating amplitudes across all leads, followed by a complete flatline at 0.00 mV for the remaining duration, which is atypical for a clinical ECG and suggests a technical failure such as disconnection or overwhelming artifact rather than true cardiac silence, especially in an 86-year-old patient with a pacemaker where paced rhythms or extra beats might be expected throughout. In the initial segment, the morphology shows rapid deflections consistent with possible QRS complexes or paced beats (e.g., positive peaks around 0.02-0.08 seconds in multiple leads), but intervals are difficult to precisely measure with only 12 data points, and abnormalities like the lack of consistent P waves or T wave inversions could relate to the pacemaker or underlying condition; however, the key irregularity is that leads I and II exhibit exactly identical values at every time point (e.g., both -0.47105 at 0.00 s, 0.57314 at 0.02 s, -0.60328 at 0.09 s), which defies standard Einthoven triangle relationships and indicates non-physiological interference, likely from shared electrode artifacts or static noise corrupting those channels equally, while other leads (III, augmented, and precordial) display independent variations suggestive of genuine signal amid baseline drift. The noted static noise in the clinical context aligns with this high-frequency erratic component superimposed on the early signal, exacerbated by electrode issues, though the prolonged flatline points more to burst noise or total signal loss than ongoing static interference, potentially masking any cardiac abnormalities like arrhythmias from extra beats.

**Final answer: Leads I and II**
