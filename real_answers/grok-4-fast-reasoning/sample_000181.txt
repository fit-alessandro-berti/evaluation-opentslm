The provided ECG time series for this 88-year-old female patient with a pacemaker reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, with meaningful signal confined to the initial 0.11 seconds before flattening to zero, likely indicating recording failure or severe artifact beyond that point, rendering a full 10-second analysis impossible. In lead aVF specifically, the early samples show a small positive deflection peaking around 0.01 seconds (0.63 mV), followed by a brief negative excursion at 0.03-0.04 seconds (-0.25 to -0.12 mV), then returning to modest positives (up to 0.38 mV at 0.05 seconds) with gradual decline, and a sharp negative spike at 0.11 seconds (-0.92 mV) that aligns with potential pacemaker activity or artifact rather than physiological waveform. This pattern does not clearly delineate a complete QRS-T complex, as the segment is too brief (only 11 samples at 100 Hz) to reliably identify ST segments or T-waves, and the negative portions appear more consistent with noise, baseline wander, or partial QRS/ST elements than a distinct inverted T-wave, which would typically present as a predominantly negative repolarization phase following a positive QRS in this inferior lead, often suggesting ischemia or strain; the pacemaker presence further complicates morphology, potentially masking or altering native T-wave polarity, and without sustained signal, no definitive abnormality like T-wave inversion can be confirmed. No, this ECG does not show signs of inverted T-waves in lead aVF.
