The ECG time series reveals a brief period of electrical activity in the initial 0.11 seconds across multiple leads, with fluctuating amplitudes in limb leads (I, II, III showing initial positive deflections transitioning to negative) and precordial leads (V1 negative, V2-V6 positive initially, then varying), suggestive of partial P-QRS-T morphology or artifacts, followed by a prominent large negative deflection around 0.11 seconds in most leads (e.g., -4.9 mV in I and II, -4.6 mV in V1), which could represent a QRS complex, pacemaker spike, or electrode artifact given the noted signal quality issues like baseline drift, noise, and electrode problems; however, the subsequent 9.88 seconds of flatline (all zeros) indicates either recording failure, lead disconnection, or suppression due to pacemaker inhibition, preventing clear visualization of ongoing rhythm over the full 10 seconds. Despite the poor quality and truncated signal, the detected extra beats in the clinical context, combined with the pacemaker presence and the irregular early deflections hinting at alternating normal and premature activity (potentially supraventricular or ventricular in origin), point toward an arrhythmic pattern rather than regular sinus rhythm, as the morphology and brief abnormalities align more with intermittent ectopy than consistent sinus node-driven beats. Bigeminal pattern (unknown origin, supraventricular, or ventricular).
