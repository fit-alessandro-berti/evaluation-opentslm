The ECG recording provided exhibits significant technical limitations, with non-zero signal confined to the initial 0.12 seconds showing irregular deflections suggestive of a few cardiac cycles amid baseline drift and artifacts, followed by a prolonged flatline indicating loss of signal quality, likely due to electrode issues, noise, or recording error as noted in the clinical context; the early morphology displays abrupt positive spikes in multiple leads (e.g., tall R waves around 0.01 and 0.10-0.11 seconds in I, II, and precordial leads) followed by negative deflections and smaller repolarizations, consistent with ventricular paced beats rather than narrow-complex rapid rhythms, and no evidence of sustained high-rate activity exceeding 100 bpm that would characterize supraventricular tachycardia, especially given the sparse beats and overall bradycardic implication from the limited data before flatline. Normal functioning artificial pacemaker.
