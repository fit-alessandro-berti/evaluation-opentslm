The provided ECG time series data for the 66-year-old female patient reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted artifacts including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, which can distort waveforms and complicate rhythm analysis. The recording spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz, but meaningful signal is limited to the initial 0.11 seconds, with all subsequent values flattening to zero, suggesting possible technical failure or truncation beyond that point, rendering the majority of the trace uninterpretable as it lacks any cardiac activity. Focusing on lead V4 within the available segment, the voltage values fluctuate erratically: starting negative at -0.71 mV (t=0.00 s), dipping to -1.37 mV (t=0.01 s), briefly rising to positive 1.12 mV (t=0.03 s) suggestive of a potential QRS complex onset amid noise, then oscillating through negatives like -0.94 mV (t=0.05 s) and -1.22 mV (t=0.09 s), interspersed with positives peaking at 1.40 mV (t=0.06 s) and dramatically at 2.59 mV (t=0.10 s), followed by 1.44 mV (t=0.11 s). These rapid swings, with intervals too brief to reliably delineate full P-QRS-T sequences (normal T-wave duration ~0.15-0.25 s), likely reflect pacemaker spikes, extra beats, or artifacts rather than clear repolarization patterns; negative deflections post-positive peaks could mimic T-wave inversions but are indistinguishable from noise or non-specific changes in this short, low-quality snippet. Without discernible ST segments or consistent T-wave morphology across multiple cycles, and given the pacemaker's influence on ventricular depolarization that often alters T-wave polarity, no reliable evidence of pathologic inverted T-waves—typically deep, symmetric negatives >1 mm in V4 indicating anterior ischemia—is identifiable. No, this ECG does not show symptoms of inverted T-waves in lead V4.
