The ECG recording for this 70-year-old female patient with a pacemaker shows significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, limiting reliable interpretation to the initial 0.12 seconds of non-zero data across all leads, with flatline thereafter suggesting possible technical failure or no further cardiac activity captured. In lead II, a standard view for P wave assessment, the signal exhibits erratic fluctuations starting from a negative baseline at 0.00 seconds (-0.31046 mV), transitioning to a brief positive deflection peaking at 0.03 seconds (0.28250 mV) before a sharp negative shift at 0.04 seconds (-0.26945 mV), potentially representing atrial depolarization amid noise, but the overall morphology is distorted by artifacts and lacks a distinct, smooth P wave contour typical of sinus rhythm. The pacemaker presence may indicate atrial pacing, which can alter P wave appearance, but no clear paced spike is evident in the noisy initial segment; extra beats further complicate rhythm analysis, possibly masking or fragmenting atrial activity. Measuring P duration—the interval from P wave onset to offset, normally 80-110 ms—is challenging due to these abnormalities, but the visible positive excursion spans only about 20-30 ms (from roughly 0.01 to 0.03 seconds) before reverting to isoelectric or negative, suggesting a shortened atrial depolarization time potentially influenced by artifacts or conduction issues in an elderly patient, rather than prolongation seen in conditions like atrial enlargement. Other leads, such as V1 showing biphasic patterns and limb leads with inconsistent polarities, reinforce the noisy, non-diagnostic quality without clear intervals for precise measurement, but the brevity of any atrial-like feature points away from extended duration.
