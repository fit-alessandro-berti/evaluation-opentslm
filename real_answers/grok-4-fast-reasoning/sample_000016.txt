The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals a brief period of electrical activity in the initial 0.12 seconds across multiple leads, characterized by negative deflections in limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) at time 0.00s, transitioning to smaller negative values by 0.01s and 0.02s, followed by a prominent positive spike around 0.03s that is consistent across leads, then returning to negative or small positive excursions by 0.04s to 0.11s, after which the signal flattens to zero amplitude for the remaining 9.88 seconds with no discernible variation. This pattern in the opening segment does not resemble typical cardiac waveforms, lacking clear P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves; instead, it appears consistent with artifacts such as electrode contact issues, baseline drift, or burst noise mentioned in the clinical context, potentially exacerbated by the presence of a pacemaker that might introduce pacing spikes but shows none here beyond possible initial transients. The prolonged flatline suggests either recording failure, lead disconnection, or suppression of signal due to noise filtering, making it impossible to evaluate rhythm regularity, intervals like PR or QT, or premature beats. Supraventricular extrasystoles would require evidence of early atrial or atrioventricular junctional beats with narrow QRS morphology and abnormal or premature P waves interrupting sinus rhythm, but no such patterns emerge amid the artifacts and absent signal; the machine-detected "extra beats" likely stem from noise misinterpretation rather than true ectopy. Thus, this ECG does not show supraventricular extrasystoles.
