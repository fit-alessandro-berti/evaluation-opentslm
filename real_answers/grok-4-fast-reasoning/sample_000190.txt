The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals electrical activity confined to the first 0.12 seconds across the 12 leads, with fluctuating amplitudes in leads such as II (peaking at approximately 0.77 mV at 0.05 seconds) and V6 (reaching up to 6.59 mV at 0.07 seconds), suggestive of QRS complexes or paced ventricular depolarizations given the patient's pacemaker, while leads like aVR and V1 show inverted or smaller deflections consistent with normal vector orientations or artifacts; however, the morphology appears irregular with abrupt changes, such as a sharp positive spike in V6 from 0.06 to 0.08 seconds potentially indicating a pacing artifact or premature activation, followed by a rapid return to baseline. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the brevity of the active segment—spanning only about one potential beat cycle—and the immediate transition to a flatline (all leads at 0 mV from 0.12 seconds onward), which aligns with the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, likely rendering subsequent rhythm unrecordable or suppressed. This truncated, noisy signal complicates definitive assessment of rhythm regularity, but the clinical context of extra beats and the anomalous high-amplitude, isolated deflections in the initial portion point toward premature ventricular or supraventricular extrasystoles disrupting an otherwise paced rhythm, without evidence of compensatory pauses or consistent sinus morphology in the visible data.
