The provided ECG recording is severely compromised by its brevity, with meaningful signal confined to the initial 0.11 seconds before flattening to zero, aligning with the reported poor signal quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in a patient with a pacemaker, making interpretation challenging but necessitating focus on limb lead morphology for axis assessment. Examining leads I and aVF, which are key for determining QRS axis, reveals irregular, low-amplitude deflections suggestive of fragmented or artifactual complexes rather than clear P-QRS-T waves, potentially representing paced beats given the clinical context; lead I shows predominantly negative net deflections overall (e.g., deep troughs at -0.476 mV around 0.04 s and -0.542 mV at 0.08 s, with only transient small positives like +0.311 mV at 0.02 s), while aVF displays mixed polarity but with significant negatives (e.g., -0.674 mV at 0.04 s) outweighing positives (+0.417 mV at 0.02 s), indicating a superior and leftward frontal plane vector. The pacemaker presence further supports this, as right ventricular pacing commonly produces a left bundle branch block pattern with left axis deviation (QRS axis ≤ -30°), where the early septal activation from the right ventricle shifts the mean QRS vector leftward and posteriorly; intervals cannot be reliably measured due to noise, but the morphology in the limb leads—negative in I and equivocal-to-negative in aVF—points away from normal or right axis toward deviation, without evidence of rightward shift. No, this ECG does not show left axis deviation; the noisy, incomplete signal precludes definitive axis calculation, but the patterns are more consistent with indeterminate or normal axis amid artifacts.
