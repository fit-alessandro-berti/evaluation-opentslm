Examining the time series for lead V1 reveals a highly irregular signal over the initial 0.12 seconds, with abrupt amplitude swings from +4.50 mV to -2.00 mV and then to -4.31 mV in rapid succession, followed by erratic oscillations up to +4.99 mV before abruptly flattening to zero, lacking any discernible P-QRS-T morphology or consistent rhythm that would indicate cardiac activity amid the noted pacemaker presence and extra beats. These sudden, high-amplitude deflections resemble intermittent spikes rather than fine, persistent fluctuations, aligning with the clinical context of multiple artifacts including baseline drift and electrode issues, while the absence of ongoing low-level random jitter points away from typical static interference. The patterns suggest burst noise, as the disruptions are focal and intense over short durations, potentially exacerbated by the pacemaker or recording quality issues.
