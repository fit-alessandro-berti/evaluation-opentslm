The ECG time series displays brief electrical activity in the initial 0.11 seconds across multiple leads, with deflections in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1-V6 showing positive and negative voltages that could represent fragmented QRS complexes or artifacts amid the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode issues, potentially indicating extra beats as detected during recording; however, from 0.12 seconds to the end of the 10-second trace, all leads remain at zero voltage without any P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves, suggesting a complete cessation of organized cardiac electrical activity despite the presence of a pacemaker, which raises concern for device malfunction such as failure to pace or capture. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the brevity and noise in the active segment, but the morphology lacks consistent rhythm patterns, with no evidence of sinus rhythm, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, or paced beats beyond the initial noisy period, collectively pointing to profound conduction failure or absent rhythm generation. This ECG shows asystole.
