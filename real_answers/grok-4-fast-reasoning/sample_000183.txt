The provided ECG time series data for this 26-year-old female patient reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, which likely contribute to the abrupt transition to zero values across all leads after just 0.12 seconds of recording. In the initial non-zero segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, the voltage amplitudes in leads like III (peaking at approximately 7 mV) and II (around 2-6 mV) appear unusually elevated and irregular, potentially reflecting pacemaker spikes or artifacts rather than physiological waveforms, while leads such as aVL and V5 show smaller deflections that do not form recognizable P-QRS-T complexes or consistent cardiac cycles at the 100 Hz sampling rate over this brief 10-second trace. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the lack of full heartbeats, and there are no clear morphological features like persistent ST-segment elevation, evolving Q waves, or T-wave inversions that would indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction in any territorial distribution; instead, the data suggests a non-diagnostic recording dominated by noise and incomplete capture, possibly from pacemaker interference or technical failure, making it impossible to assess for middle-stage myocardial infarction changes such as partial resolution of acute ST elevation with emerging Q waves. No, this ECG does not show the middle stage of myocardial infarction.
