The provided ECG time series reveals significant technical issues, with only the initial 0.12 seconds displaying any electrical activity—characterized by abrupt, synchronized deflections across multiple leads that appear more consistent with artifacts like baseline drift, static or burst noise, and electrode misplacement as described in the clinical context, rather than coherent cardiac waveforms—followed by a prolonged flatline (isoelectric line at 0 mV) for the remaining duration, which is atypical for a 10-second recording and suggests recording failure, lead disconnection, or suppression of signal in the presence of a pacemaker. This lack of ongoing QRS complexes, ST segments, or T waves prevents reliable assessment of intervals, axis, or morphology; for instance, inferolateral ischemia typically manifests as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversions in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6, while left anterior fascicular block requires evidence of left axis deviation (greater than -45 degrees), small q waves in I and aVL, and rS patterns in inferior leads, none of which can be evaluated here due to the absence of measurable beats or extra beats despite their detection note. The pacemaker presence implies potential paced rhythms, but no pacing spikes, capture, or underlying conduction abnormalities are visible amid the noise and flatline, rendering the trace non-diagnostic overall. Given the exclusion of uncertain symptoms, this ECG does not demonstrate either ischemic changes in inferolateral leads or left anterior fascicular block.

Final answer: neither
