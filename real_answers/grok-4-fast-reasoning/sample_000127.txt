The time series data for this 12-lead ECG reveals significant issues right from the outset, with only the first 0.11 seconds showing any voltage fluctuations across leads—ranging from approximately -1 mV in limb leads to peaks up to +7 mV in precordial leads like V4 and V5, which could represent artifacts, pacemaker spikes, or fragmented QRS morphology given the clinical note of a pacemaker and extra beats—but immediately transitioning to a complete flatline at 0 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, indicative of a profound recording failure rather than physiological silence. This truncated signal, compounded by the documented poor quality (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts), precludes identification of full cardiac cycles or repeatable waveforms, making it impossible to quantify essential numeric features such as heart rate (no RR intervals measurable beyond the initial noise), PR interval (no consistent P waves), QRS duration (potential early deflections are obscured by artifacts and too brief), QT interval, or even basic amplitudes like R-wave height in a stable context. The flatline portion mimics ventricular asystole, which is markedly abnormal for a 68-year-old patient, and the initial variability does not align with normal sinus rhythm morphology, suggesting instead pacemaker-related irregularities or technical errors dominating the trace. Consequently, no numeric ECG features fall within normal ranges due to the inability to derive them from valid, sustained signal data.
