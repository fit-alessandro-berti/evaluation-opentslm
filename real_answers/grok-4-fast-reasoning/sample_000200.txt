The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a predominantly flatline recording after the initial 0.11 seconds, where all lead values drop to zero, suggesting a technical failure or incomplete capture rather than physiological silence; in the non-zero portion, leads I, II, and others exhibit irregular fluctuations with amplitudes ranging from -0.282 mV to +0.689 mV, including a prominent positive deflection around 0.02 seconds potentially indicative of a QRS complex, followed by negative deflections and smaller waves that could represent T-wave or artifactual noise, but the brevity limits assessment of intervals like RR or QT, and no clear P waves or consistent rhythm are discernible. The presence of a pacemaker implies possible pacing spikes, yet none are distinctly visible amid the noise, and the detected extra beats in the clinical context align with premature complexes, but the morphology in leads V1-V6 shows broad, aberrant patterns in the initial segment (e.g., V6 reaching +3.103 mV at 0.05 seconds, suggestive of ventricular origin rather than supraventricular), lacking preceding atrial activity and occurring in an irregular pattern consistent with ectopy rather than paced or sinus rhythm. Abnormalities such as the abrupt signal cessation and noisy baseline further obscure definitive measurement of QRS width (>120 ms would support ventricular extrasystoles), but the overall irregular, aberrant waveforms in this truncated capture, combined with reported extra beats, point toward ventricular irritability in this 62-year-old female patient. Yes, this ECG shows ventricular extrasystoles.
