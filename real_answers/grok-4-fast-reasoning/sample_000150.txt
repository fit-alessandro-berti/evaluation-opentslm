The provided ECG time series reveals a critically compromised recording, with non-zero voltages confined to the first 0.11 seconds across all 12 leads, displaying irregular deflections that lack a complete cardiac cycle and instead suggest transient noise, electrode artifact, or possibly a paced spike given the clinical note of a pacemaker, while the remaining 9.89 seconds consist of absolute flatline (zero amplitude in every lead), which is incompatible with normal cardiac electrical activity and points to technical failure, asystole, or profound conduction block rather than diagnostic rhythms. In the brief initial segment, amplitudes fluctuate synchronously in limb and precordial leads—starting with negative baseline values around -0.3 mV in I and II, dipping to -0.7 mV at 0.01 seconds, briefly positive at 0.02 seconds, peaking positively at approximately 0.8 mV in most leads by 0.06 seconds (potentially mimicking an oversized QRS or pacing artifact without clear septal or lateral specificity), then attenuating to small positives and negatives— but without discernible P waves, PR intervals, QRS complexes, ST segments, or T waves due to the mere 120 ms duration, rendering morphology analysis impossible for infarction criteria like pathological Q waves (>40 ms wide and >25% of R wave height) or ST elevation (>1 mm in contiguous leads). Intervals cannot be measured accurately amid the noise and drift, and abnormalities such as the flatline dominate, overshadowing any subtle changes; the noted extra beats and pacemaker likely contribute to the erratic start, but no localized ST deviation or inversion pattern emerges to implicate the anteroseptal territory (V1-V4, with possible I/aVL extension) over the lateral wall (high lateral I/aVL or low lateral V5-V6, II/III/aVF), as deflections are uniform without territorial distinction. Overall, the poor signal quality precludes reliable assessment of ischemic changes, aligning with the exclusion of uncertain symptoms.

This ECG shows neither myocardial infarction in lateral leads nor myocardial infarction in anteroseptal leads.
