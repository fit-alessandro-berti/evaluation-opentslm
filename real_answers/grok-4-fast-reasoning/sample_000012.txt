The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, compounded by the presence of a pacemaker, which often alters ventricular depolarization patterns. Examining the non-zero portion from 0.00 to 0.12 seconds across the 12 leads, the initial deflections suggest an irregular rhythm with abrupt changes, such as in lead II where a positive peak at 0.00 seconds (0.86 mV) drops sharply to a negative trough at 0.02 seconds (-1.06 mV), followed by a prominent positive rebound at 0.04 seconds (1.81 mV) and subsequent oscillations, indicative of possible paced or ectopic activity rather than sinus rhythm; similarly, in V1, a deep negative deflection at 0.02 seconds (-1.78 mV) transitions to a positive peak at 0.04 seconds (1.13 mV) before another negative excursion at 0.05 seconds (-1.47 mV), hinting at fragmented or broadened ventricular activation consistent with pacemaker influence, where the impulse originates ectopically in the ventricle, leading to dyssynchronous conduction. The abrupt cessation to zero values after 0.12 seconds likely reflects recording artifact or data truncation rather than true asystole, but within the visible segment, the main QRS-like complexes appear widened by noise and pacing effects, spanning approximately 0.05-0.08 seconds (50-80 ms) in cleaner segments like the initial negative-to-positive transition in limb leads, though artifacts obscure precise onset and offset, potentially underestimating duration; however, the overall morphology, including notched or slurred appearances in precordial leads (e.g., V2-V3 showing prolonged recovery phases), and the clinical context of a pacemaker in a young adult, point to abnormal intraventricular conduction delay beyond typical sinus QRS patterns. No, the QRS duration does not fall above the normal range in this analysis, as the measurable complexes align with or below 120 ms despite the confounding factors.
