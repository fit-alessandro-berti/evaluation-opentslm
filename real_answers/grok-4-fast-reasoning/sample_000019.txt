Examining the time series data for lead V2 at 100 Hz over 10 seconds reveals a brief initial segment of activity from 0 to 0.11 seconds with fluctuating amplitudes starting at approximately 0.95 mV, rising sharply to 2.00 mV and peaking near 2.19 mV, then dropping abruptly to -1.61 mV, recovering slightly to -0.50 mV, spiking again to 2.30 mV, and descending through negative values to about -0.23 mV before a small positive deflection to 0.11 mV; these rapid swings suggest possible premature ventricular contractions or pacemaker spikes amid irregular morphology, but the values align with detected extra beats and pacemaker presence in the clinical context. However, from 0.12 seconds onward, the signal flatlines completely at 0.00 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which is highly abnormal for an ECG lead monitoring cardiac electrical activity, indicating a severe disruption rather than physiological silence, as the heart would continue generating potentials. This prolonged isoelectric line contrasts with expected baseline wander or subtle noise patterns, pointing instead to a loss of signal integrity, likely due to electrode detachment or connection failure, while the early segment shows superimposed irregularities like high-frequency static fluctuations around the deflections (potentially static noise) and a sudden baseline shift at 0.03 seconds (suggesting baseline drift), but no clear burst noise in the visible data. Overall, the dominant abnormality in V2 is the extended flatline artifact, compromising the lead's reliability for assessing intervals like PR or QT, or morphologies such as ST segments, and underscoring the need for re-recording to evaluate any underlying cardiac condition obscured by these issues.

The ECG in lead V2 shows primarily electrode artifacts manifesting as a prolonged flatline, with elements of baseline drift and static noise in the initial segment.
