Examining the provided ECG time series data for lead V3, which spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz sampling, reveals a brief segment of activity from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds with fluctuating amplitudes starting at -0.218 mV, dipping to -0.254 mV, rising to 0.303 mV, then showing larger excursions to 1.419 mV and a sharp drop to -2.043 mV, followed by oscillations between positive and negative values up to -1.388 mV and back to 0.228 mV before ending at -0.724 mV; after 0.11 seconds, the signal remains flat at 0.000 mV for the duration. These initial rapid amplitude changes in V3 suggest significant instability in the isoelectric baseline, characterized by abrupt shifts rather than smooth, low-frequency wandering typically associated with respiratory or motion-induced drift, but the clinical context explicitly notes baseline drift in the recording alongside noise and artifacts, which aligns with the observed non-stationary behavior in this precordial lead before the signal abruptly flattens, potentially indicating electrode issues or recording interruption affecting baseline stability. The morphology in this short active period lacks clear P-QRS-T complexes due to the brevity and noise, with intervals impossible to measure accurately, but the deviations from a steady zero line in V3 confirm abnormal baseline variability consistent with drift rather than normal cardiac patterns or isolated extrasystoles from the pacemaker. Yes, this ECG shows baseline drift in lead V3.
