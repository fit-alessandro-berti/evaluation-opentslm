The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to its limited duration of meaningful signalâ€”only the first 0.11 seconds show any voltage deflections across the leads, with values fluctuating between approximately -0.8 mV and +0.9 mV, suggesting possible initial artifacts, noise, or partial capture of cardiac activity, while the remaining 9.89 seconds consist entirely of zero values, indicating a flatline or complete signal loss, which aligns with the noted poor quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats. In a standard 12-lead ECG at 100 Hz for 10 seconds, one would expect multiple cardiac cycles with identifiable P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves to measure intervals like QT, but here the abrupt cessation precludes visualization of any complete heartbeat morphology or rhythm; the early deflections do not form recognizable QRS-T patterns, and the pacemaker presence further complicates assessment as paced rhythms can alter repolarization timings. Without measurable RR intervals for heart rate correction or clear Q-on to T-end points, evaluating whether the QT falls within the normal range of 350-440 ms (or corrected QTc <440 ms for males) is not feasible, as the data lacks sufficient diagnostic content.

No, the QT interval cannot be determined to be within the normal range due to inadequate signal quality and absence of usable waveforms.
