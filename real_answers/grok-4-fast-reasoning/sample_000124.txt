Examining the ECG time series data for lead III reveals irregular and abrupt voltage fluctuations in the initial 0.12 seconds of recording, with values jumping sharply from positive to negative amplitudes—such as from 0.303 mV at 0.00 s to -0.939 mV at 0.02 s, then rebounding to 0.626 mV at 0.04 s before dropping to -0.701 mV at 0.05 s—suggesting sudden, high-amplitude disruptions rather than consistent low-level interference, while the remainder of the trace from 0.12 s onward flattens to zero, potentially indicating recording cessation or a prolonged artifact, but without discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves in the available segment due to the noise obscuring any underlying cardiac morphology or pacemaker spikes, and in the context of noted electrode artifacts and extra beats, these patterns align more closely with intermittent, spike-like disturbances than diffuse high-frequency overlay.
