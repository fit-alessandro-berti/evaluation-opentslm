The ECG recording provided is markedly compromised by its extremely limited duration of meaningful signal (only the initial 0.12 seconds show non-zero values across leads, with the remainder flatlined at zero, likely due to recording errors or truncation), compounded by noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, which collectively obscure clear identification of standard waveforms for interval measurement. In lead II, a commonly used lead for QT assessment, the time series reveals abrupt deflections suggestive of pacemaker spikes or artifacts rather than a clean sinus rhythm: a sharp positive peak around 0.01-0.02 seconds (potentially an R wave or paced QRS onset), a deep negative excursion at 0.03-0.04 seconds (S wave-like), followed by another positive bump at 0.05 seconds and gradual return toward baseline with negative values through 0.11 seconds, indicating possible ST segment or early T wave activity amid noise. This partial cycle spans roughly 100-110 ms from apparent QRS start to the end of visible repolarization, far shorter than a full QT interval and insufficient for accurate calculation, especially without heart rate data to compute QTc (Bazett's formula or similar), though for a 60-year-old male, normal QT typically ranges 350-440 ms at 60 bpm. The pacemaker likely contributes to the irregular morphology and short apparent intervals, as paced beats often exhibit altered conduction without true prolongation, and the artifacts prevent reliable delineation of Q onset or T end; no clear evidence of T wave inversion, U waves, or extended repolarization suggestive of prolongation (e.g., >450 ms QTc) is discernible in the noisy snippet, implying the observable interval does not exceed normal limits despite the diagnostic challenges. Within the normal range.
