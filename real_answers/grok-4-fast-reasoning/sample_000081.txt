The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the clinical context of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker, with the majority of the recording (from 0.12 seconds onward) showing flatline zero values across all leads, suggesting possible technical failure, lead disconnection, or suppression of signal post-initial capture. Focusing on the initial 0.12 seconds of non-zero data, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) and precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit irregular voltage deflections: in lead II, for instance, there is a negative deflection at 0.00-0.01 s transitioning to a positive peak at 0.02-0.03 s (potentially a QRS complex), followed by a sharp negative spike at 0.04 s and smaller undulations thereafter, which do not align with a regular sinus rhythm pattern given the short duration (roughly 120 ms, insufficient for a full cardiac cycle at typical rates). These patterns, combined with abrupt changes in morphology—such as the biphasic shifts in V5 and V6 from positive at 0.02 s to negative by 0.03-0.05 s—suggest aberrant or premature ventricular activity rather than organized sinus beats, consistent with extra systoles like premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), especially in the context of pacemaker influence where captured beats might be overridden by ectopic foci. The detected irregularities in R-R-like intervals (implied by the non-periodic spikes) and the explicit note of extra beats during recording further support arrhythmogenic activity, though noise and artifacts complicate definitive morphology assessment, such as QRS widening or T-wave inversion indicative of ectopy. Overall, the observed premature deflections amid poor signal quality point to underlying ectopic beats disrupting normal conduction.

Yes, this ECG shows extra systoles.
