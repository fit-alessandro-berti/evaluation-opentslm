The ECG recording for this 59-year-old female patient reveals a brief period of electrical activity confined to the initial 0.12 seconds across all 12 leads, characterized by fluctuating voltages—such as positive deflections in leads I and II at t=0.00 and t=0.01, followed by negative excursions in multiple leads around t=0.02 to 0.03, and a sharp negative spike in lead II at t=0.11—that could represent fragmented QRS-like complexes, possible premature beats, or artifacts influenced by the noted electrode issues and pacemaker presence, though no clear pacing spikes are discernible amid the noise. However, this short burst immediately gives way to a complete flatline with zero voltage in all leads for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which starkly deviates from expected normal sinus rhythm or paced rhythm patterns, where repeating P-QRS-T sequences should occur every 0.6 to 1.0 seconds at a typical heart rate of 60-100 bpm, with measurable PR intervals (0.12-0.20 s), QRS durations (<0.12 s), and QT intervals adjusted for rate. The prolonged absence of any cardiac signal, despite the detection of extra beats and the patient's pacemaker, suggests profound conduction failure, asystole, or total signal dropout due to the documented baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifacts compromising recording quality; this morphology lacks identifiable atrial or ventricular activity, axis deviation, or hypertrophy signs, but the flatline itself indicates a critical abnormality requiring urgent clinical correlation and re-evaluation.

Yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms, primarily manifested as a flatline suggestive of asystole or severe recording artifact in the context of a pacemaker.
