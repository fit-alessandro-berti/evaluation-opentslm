The provided ECG time series data exhibits significant issues from the outset, with non-zero signal confined to the initial 0.12 seconds across all 12 leads, displaying erratic amplitude fluctuations—such as rapid shifts from negative deflections around -0.25 to -0.68 mV in limb leads to brief positive excursions up to +0.48 mV and back to negatives, alongside varying precordial values that do not align with coherent P-QRS-T morphology—likely representing baseline drift, electrode artifacts, static or burst noise as noted in the clinical context, rather than true cardiac electrical activity. Beyond 0.12 seconds, the complete flatline at 0.00000 mV for nearly 10 seconds is incompatible with any physiological heart rhythm, including paced beats from the reported pacemaker, suggesting a recording failure or equipment malfunction that obscures any potential extra beats detected during acquisition. In a standard 10-second ECG at 100 Hz, one would expect multiple cardiac cycles with identifiable intervals (e.g., PR 120-200 ms, QRS <120 ms) and morphologies to assess for supraventricular extrasystoles, characterized by premature atrial or junctional beats with narrow QRS complexes and possibly aberrant P waves, but the absence of discernible waveforms precludes such analysis, rendering the trace uninterpretable for arrhythmias.

No, this ECG does not show supraventricular extrasystoles due to inadequate signal quality and lack of identifiable cardiac complexes.
