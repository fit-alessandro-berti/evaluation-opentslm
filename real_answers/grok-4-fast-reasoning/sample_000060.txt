The provided ECG time series captures only a brief segment of cardiac activity in the initial 0.12 seconds before flattening to zero, likely representing a single complex amid significant noise including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in the context of a pacemaker, which complicates precise interval measurement but suggests paced ventricular depolarization; examining leads like II and V1 reveals irregular deflections with a prominent R wave around 0.06-0.10 seconds amid artifacts, while V3 and V4 show high-amplitude fluctuations indicative of abnormal morphology potentially from pacing spikes or capture, and the overall pattern lacks clear, narrow Q-R-S transitions typical of intrinsic conduction, instead displaying broader, slurred complexes consistent with ventricular pacing where conduction through myocardium rather than specialized pathways prolongs depolarization. The QRS duration falls above the normal range.

**Final Answer: above the normal range**
