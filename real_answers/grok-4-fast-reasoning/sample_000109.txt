The provided ECG time series data for this 32-year-old female patient reveals significant abnormalities in cardiac rhythm, beginning with irregular voltage fluctuations across multiple leads in the initial 0.12 seconds that suggest possible artifactual noise or a brief, aberrant electrical event—such as an extra beat or pacemaker spike—characterized by rapid shifts from negative deflections around -1.2 mV to positive peaks exceeding 2 mV in lead II, with inconsistent morphology that does not clearly delineate P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves, compounded by the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts that obscure any reliable interpretation of intervals like PR or QT. Following this short burst, the signal flattens to zero voltage for the remaining approximately 9.88 seconds across all 12 leads, indicating a profound absence of organized cardiac electrical activity, which, in the context of a documented pacemaker, points to potential device malfunction, failure to pace, or underlying asystole rather than a normal sinus rhythm or paced rhythm, as no repetitive QRS patterns or pacing artifacts are evident throughout the recording. This prolonged flatline is highly suggestive of a critical rhythm disturbance, such as cardiac arrest or severe bradyarrhythmia, warranting immediate clinical correlation and further investigation, though the poor signal quality limits definitive morphology assessment.

Yes, this ECG shows rhythm-related symptoms, specifically apparent asystole or pacemaker non-capture.
