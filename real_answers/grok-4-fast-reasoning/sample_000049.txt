The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker with detected extra beats, all of which obscure clear cardiac waveforms across the 12 leads. The initial 0.11 seconds show irregular deflections, such as a broad negative spike at 0.01 seconds affecting all leads uniformly (suggesting possible artifact or paced QRS morphology rather than natural conduction), followed by positive excursions at 0.03 seconds in limb and precordial leads that could represent P waves or repolarization, interspersed with small negatives and another deep negative at 0.08 seconds, but these patterns lack consistent rhythm or identifiable PR, QRS, or ST segments over multiple cycles. From 0.12 seconds onward, all leads flatline at zero, indicating either recording failure or data truncation, preventing assessment of intervals like QT or RR, and making it impossible to evaluate ST-segment elevation, depression, or T-wave inversions reliably for ischemic or injury patterns. In anterolateral leads (I, aVL, V4-V6), there are no discernible horizontal or downsloping ST depressions or symmetric T-wave changes indicative of ischemia, while anteroseptal leads (V1-V3) show no clear subendocardial injury signs like diffuse ST depression without reciprocal changes, as the noise and brevity dominate any potential abnormalities, rendering both options uncertain.

Final answer: neither (uncertain due to poor signal quality and artifacts)
