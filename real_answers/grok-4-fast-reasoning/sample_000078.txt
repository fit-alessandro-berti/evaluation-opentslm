The ECG time series data for this 81-year-old male with a pacemaker reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, which complicate precise interpretation but point to abnormal repolarization patterns across multiple leads over the initial 0.12 seconds of recording before flattening to zero, likely due to recording artifacts or incomplete capture in this 10-second trace. Examining the morphology, the early deflections show wide QRS complexes consistent with ventricular pacing, with prominent R waves in leads I, II, and V2-V6 reaching amplitudes around 1.0-1.7 mV, followed by deep S waves (e.g., -1.04 mV in lead I at 0.04 s), suggesting a left bundle branch block-like pattern typical of right ventricular pacing; the ST segments appear subtly depressed relative to the preceding TP baseline in limb leads like II, III, and aVF (e.g., transitioning from S wave nadir to T onset with minimal upsloping but overall below isoelectric line amid noise), while T waves demonstrate biphasic or predominantly negative deflections in several leads (e.g., in lead I, peaking positively at 0.69 mV at 0.05 s but inverting to -0.42 mV by 0.08 s, and similarly negative in aVR and V1 post-QRS), indicating repolarization abnormalities potentially from ischemia, electrolyte shifts, or pacing-induced changes rather than specific ischemic ST depression. Intervals are prolonged, with paced QRS durations estimated at 0.08-0.10 s based on the sharp transitions, and the overall noisy, artifact-laden trace with extra beats obscures definitive J-point measurements, but the repolarization changes align more closely with T-wave inversions across precordial and augmented leads than isolated non-specific ST shifts, especially given the patient's age and pacemaker presence which often manifests discordant or inverted T waves without implying acute pathology. Non-specific ST depression is suggested in inferior leads due to the subtle baseline shifts and noise, but the dominant feature is the T-wave morphology alterations.

Final answer: inverted t-waves
