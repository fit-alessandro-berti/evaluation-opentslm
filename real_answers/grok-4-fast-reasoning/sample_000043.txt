Examining the provided ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds reveals initial non-zero deflections in multiple leads from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, with varying amplitudes such as negative peaks in I, II, and augmented leads around -0.24 to -1.74 mV and positive excursions up to 0.81 mV in II and V leads, suggesting possible early cardiac activity or artifactual onset, potentially influenced by the noted pacemaker and extra beats; however, from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly flatten to exactly 0.00000 mV without any variation, which deviates from expected rhythmic ECG morphology like repeating P-QRS-T patterns every 0.8-1.0 seconds in a 48-year-old male, indicating signal loss or recording failure rather than physiological conduction. This prolonged isoelectric baseline lacks typical low-frequency baseline wander but also shows no high-frequency random fluctuations characteristic of static noise, such as fine, irregular oscillations from 50/60 Hz interference or poor electrode contact; instead, the uniformity of zeros points more toward complete signal dropout or data truncation, though the clinical context explicitly notes static noise presence alongside baseline drift, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which could imply undetected subtle irregularities in the initial segment or unrepresented in this sampled data. Overall, while the morphology in the brief initial capture appears irregular and potentially artifact-laden, the dominant flatline pattern does not demonstrate ongoing static noise.

Final answer: Yes
