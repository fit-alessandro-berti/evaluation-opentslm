The ECG recording in lead II reveals a brief segment of activity in the first 0.12 seconds, characterized by abrupt and irregular amplitude variations ranging from approximately -0.83 mV to +0.62 mV across consecutive samples, followed by a prolonged flatline at 0 mV for the remaining duration, which disrupts the expected rhythmic cardiac morphology and suggests significant recording interference rather than typical sinus or paced rhythms given the patient's age and pacemaker presence. These sharp, erratic shifts in the active portion do not align with the smooth, low-frequency undulations of baseline drift, such as those caused by respiration or electrode movement, but instead resemble high-frequency random perturbations superimposed on potential QRS complexes or extra beats, consistent with static noise from electrical interference or poor signal acquisition. The absence of gradual baseline wandering and the presence of this jittery pattern, combined with noted electrode artifacts and overall poor signal quality, point away from primary low-frequency drift and toward high-frequency noise as the dominant issue impacting interpretability in lead II, though the flatline may reflect a technical failure rather than ongoing noise. Static noise.
