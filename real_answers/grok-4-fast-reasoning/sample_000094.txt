The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals a brief period of electrical activity confined to the initial 0.12 seconds across all 12 leads, characterized by fluctuating amplitudes that suggest a single cardiac complex—starting with elevated positive deflections in leads I, II, and precordial leads around 1.3-1.8 mV at t=0.00-0.01, followed by a drop to near-zero or low positive values at t=0.02, a sharp negative excursion to approximately -1.6 mV in multiple leads at t=0.03 indicative of a possible QRS morphology with inferior axis deviation, subsequent repolarization waves with positive recoveries peaking again near 1.2 mV at t=0.05 and tapering to small positive or negative fluctuations by t=0.06-0.11—potentially representing a ventricular depolarization event, possibly paced given the clinical context of a pacemaker, though no distinct sharp pacing spikes are discernible amid the noted baseline drift and noise; however, from t=0.12 onward, all leads exhibit complete electrical silence with zero voltage throughout the remaining 9.88 seconds, which, in the absence of ongoing artifacts explaining the entirety of the flatline, points to a profound lack of subsequent cardiac electrical activity despite the patient's age and pacemaker presence, suggesting an inability to generate or capture further beats, while the poor signal quality including static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats introduces uncertainty around rhythm origin but does not alter the clear post-complex absence of signals. The diagnostic symptoms shown are a single ventricular complex followed by asystole, with evidence of pacemaker failure to pace.
