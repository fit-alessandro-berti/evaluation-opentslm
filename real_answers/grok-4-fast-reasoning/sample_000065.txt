The ECG time series provided exhibits extremely limited electrical activity, confined to the initial 0.12 seconds where sporadic deflections occur across multiple leads, such as negative baseline shifts in I, II, and aVR at 0.00 seconds, a prominent positive peak in II, V1, V2, and others around 0.02-0.03 seconds suggestive of a possible QRS-like complex or artifact, followed by smaller fluctuations that could represent T waves or noise before abruptly flattening. From 0.12 seconds onward through the entire 10-second duration, all leads remain at zero amplitude without any discernible P waves, QRS complexes, ST segments, or T waves, indicating a complete absence of ongoing cardiac depolarization-repolarization cycles. This flatline pattern is highly atypical for a 72-year-old male, particularly with a noted pacemaker, which should generate visible pacing spikes and paced ventricular rhythms at regular intervals (typically 60-100 bpm), alongside potential intrinsic or paced atrial activity; instead, the prolonged isoelectric line aligns more with recording failure, severe signal artifact from the documented baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode issues, or equipment malfunction rather than physiological normality. The brief initial activity might reflect extra beats or artifacts as mentioned, but lacks the repetitive morphology, appropriate intervals (e.g., PR ~120-200 ms, QRS <120 ms, QTc ~350-440 ms), and axis (normal -30° to +90°) expected in a standard sinus or paced rhythm, further compounded by the patient's age-related risks for abnormalities like conduction delays or hypertrophy, none of which are assessable here due to the lack of usable signal.

No, this is not a normal ECG.
