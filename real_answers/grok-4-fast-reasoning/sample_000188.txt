Examining the provided ECG time series data for lead V4 reveals a brief segment of activity from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, where the signal exhibits distinct deflections such as a sharp positive peak at 2.46 mV around 0.02 seconds, followed by a negative excursion to -1.30 mV at 0.04 seconds and subsequent oscillations up to 1.44 mV at 0.05 seconds and down to -0.26 mV by 0.09 seconds, which align with typical ECG waveform morphology including possible P-QRS-T components or extra beats as noted in the clinical context, rather than random high-frequency fluctuations indicative of static noise. Beyond 0.11 seconds, the trace remains at a flat zero baseline for the entire remaining 9.89 seconds, suggesting signal loss possibly due to electrode artifact, baseline drift, or recording interruption rather than ongoing noise. While the overall recording notes static noise, burst noise, and artifacts, the patterns in V4 do not demonstrate the characteristic erratic, low-amplitude, broadband interference of static noise across the trace; instead, the initial variations appear physiologically coherent, and the prolonged flatline lacks any noisy perturbations. Therefore, this ECG does not show static noise in lead V4.

Final Answer: No
