The provided ECG time series captures only a brief 0.12-second segment of non-zero activity at the onset, followed by nearly 10 seconds of flatline (zero voltage across all leads), which is highly atypical for a standard 12-lead recording and suggests significant technical issues such as complete signal loss, profound baseline suppression from the noted drift and artifacts, or possible equipment failure despite the pacemaker's presence; within the initial segment, the voltages in leads I, II, and III show rapid fluctuations from negative deflections around -0.4 mV at t=0.00 s to sharp positive peaks exceeding 1.2 mV by t=0.02 s, then deep negatives to -1.28 mV at t=0.04 s, with corresponding changes in precordial leads V1-V6 displaying progressive diminution from V1 to V6, indicative of erratic, low-amplitude noise or burst artifacts rather than coherent cardiac waveforms, as the short duration precludes identification of P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves necessary for assessing rhythm; intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the brevity and irregularity, and no clear premature narrow-complex beats with aberrant P morphology—hallmarks of supraventricular extrasystoles—are discernible amid the static and electrode noise, especially with the flatline dominating the trace, which might reflect pacemaker inhibition or asystole but lacks evidence of supraventricular origin for any extrasystoles. No, this ECG does not show supraventricular extrasystoles.
