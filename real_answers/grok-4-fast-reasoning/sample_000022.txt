The ECG time series reveals a brief period of electrical activity in the initial 0.12 seconds across multiple leads, with voltage deflections ranging from approximately -1.74 mV to +2.31 mV that could represent artifacts, premature beats, or partial cardiac complexes influenced by the noted pacemaker, but these are immediately followed by a prolonged flatline of zeros for the remaining nearly 10 seconds, which is atypical and likely due to the reported signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and possibly recording failure or filtering errors. This lack of sustained rhythm prevents identification of complete P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves, making it impossible to measure key intervals like PR (normally 120-200 ms), QRS duration (normally <120 ms), or QT (normally <440 ms corrected for a 17-year-old female), and heart rate cannot be assessed as no RR intervals are present; the morphology shows no clear axis deviation or hypertrophy patterns, but the overall absence of ongoing signal suggests technical inadequacy rather than a specific cardiac condition like asystole, though the pacemaker presence raises concern for potential device malfunction or lead issues without further data. Given the incomplete and noisy capture, no reliable numeric features can be evaluated against normal ranges.
