The provided ECG time series reveals significant technical limitations, with electrical activity confined to the initial 0.12 seconds across all 12 leads, followed by a prolonged flatline at zero voltage for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which is highly atypical and suggests either recording failure, profound asystole, or severe artifact masking ongoing rhythm, especially in light of the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats in a patient with a pacemaker. In the brief active segment, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show erratic deflections with amplitudes ranging from approximately -2.83 mV to +1.51 mV, potentially indicative of paced QRS complexes or artifacts rather than sinus rhythm, while precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit smaller, inconsistent variations up to +0.44 mV in V3 and down to -0.93 mV, lacking clear P waves, consistent ST segments, or T waves due to the brevity and noise; the pacemaker presence likely accounts for sharp spikes, such as the abrupt negative excursion at 0.11 seconds, but no full cardiac cycle is captured to reliably measure intervals like PR (normal 120-200 ms), QRS duration (normal <120 ms), or QT (normal 350-440 ms adjusted for rate). Observed patterns point to unreliable morphology, with no discernible axis (normal -30 to +90 degrees) or rate (normal 60-100 bpm), and the flatline post-0.12 seconds implies absent atrial or ventricular activity, consistent with potential pacemaker malfunction or recording error rather than a stable cardiac condition. Among measurable numeric features in this limited data, the peak-to-peak voltage swings in limb leads (roughly 2-4 mV across deflections) fall within normal ranges for QRS amplitude (typically 0.5-2.5 mV in standard calibrations, though units here appear normalized), and the absence of excessive ST elevation or depression in the visible portion suggests no acute ischemic changes exceeding normal variability (<1 mm or 0.1 mV).

Final answer: QRS amplitude in limb leads (2-4 mV peak-to-peak).
