The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, with the majority of the recording from 0.12 seconds onward showing flat zero values across all leads, suggesting either recording failure or artifactual suppression after the initial segment, while the first 0.12 seconds captures a brief but informative portion of cardiac activity in this 78-year-old male with a pacemaker. In this short window, lead II demonstrates an initial negative deflection around 0.00-0.01 seconds rising to a positive peak at 0.03 seconds (approximately 0.60 mV), followed by a sharp negative excursion at 0.04 seconds (-0.57 mV), a brief recovery, and then another positive deflection peaking at 0.08 seconds (0.50 mV) before declining negatively, indicating closely spaced waveforms that could represent a primary beat followed by an early abnormality rather than typical sinus rhythm given the compressed timing of about 50 ms between peaks, which is shorter than expected for standard intervals but consistent with premature activity amid noise. Precordial leads V1-V6 show corresponding patterns, with V1 transitioning from negative (-0.77 mV at 0.00) to positive (0.55 mV at 0.03) then deeply negative (-0.83 mV at 0.04), and later positive again (0.65 mV at 0.08), while lateral leads V4-V6 exhibit tall R waves (up to 1.22 mV in V6 at 0.08), suggesting ventricular origin due to the broad, aberrant morphology and discordance, particularly the negative deflection in V1-V3 at 0.04 seconds resembling a left bundle branch block-like pattern often seen in ventricular ectopy or paced beats, and the absence of clear preceding P waves in augmented leads points away from atrial origin. The presence of a pacemaker likely indicates ventricular pacing, where the extra beat disrupts the paced rhythm, evidenced by the irregular, non-sinus morphology and the detected extra beats in the clinical context, with intervals too brief for compensatory pauses but aligning with premature ventricular depolarization rather than atrial, as the QRS-like complexes appear wide (spanning roughly 30-40 ms with artifacts) and bizarre without typical ST-T concordance. This pattern, combined with the patient's age and pacemaker, suggests an ectopic ventricular focus interrupting normal conduction.
