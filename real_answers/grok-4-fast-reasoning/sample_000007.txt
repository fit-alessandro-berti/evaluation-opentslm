The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats in the context of a pacemaker in this 87-year-old female patient. Beginning with the initial 0.12 seconds, the leads display irregular deflections: starting with negative voltages across most leads (suggesting possible repolarization phases or T waves), transitioning to prominent positive spikes in leads I, II, V2-V5 around 0.02-0.03 seconds (potentially indicative of QRS complexes, possibly paced given the morphology and simultaneous involvement of multiple leads), followed by negative excursions and smaller fluctuations up to 0.11 seconds that could represent premature beats or artifacts rather than organized atrial or ventricular activity. However, from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly flatline at 0.00 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which is highly abnormal and not consistent with any physiological cardiac rhythm, as it implies complete absence of electrical activity without ongoing P waves, QRS complexes, or pacemaker spikes. This pattern suggests a profound rhythm disturbance, such as ventricular asystole, pacemaker failure (e.g., failure to capture or output), or severe recording artifact overriding true signals, rather than a stable sinus, paced, or arrhythmic rhythm; the brief initial activity hints at intermittent conduction but lacks sufficient duration or regularity to confirm rate, intervals (PR, QRS, QT appear unmeasurable), or morphology for definitive arrhythmia classification like atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, or ectopy. Overall, the ECG does not demonstrate a normal or sustainable rhythm but instead highlights critical abnormalities in cardiac electrical activity.

Yes, this ECG shows rhythm-related symptoms, primarily manifested as apparent asystole or pacemaker dysfunction following brief initial deflections.
