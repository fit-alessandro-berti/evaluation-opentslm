The ECG signal in lead aVL over the initial 0.11 seconds reveals a series of irregular deflections amid noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, starting with a small negative baseline at -0.10 mV that quickly rises to a modest positive peak of 0.22 mV around 0.02 seconds, followed by a brief return to positive 0.05 mV at 0.03 seconds before dropping sharply to -0.15 mV at 0.04 seconds, then rebounding to positive values near 0.16 mV at 0.05-0.06 seconds, and subsequently plunging into a deep negative excursion reaching -0.47 mV by 0.09 seconds with a slight recovery to -0.33 mV at 0.11 seconds, after which the signal flatlines to zero, likely due to recording limitations or artifact masking. This pattern suggests an abnormal QRS morphology characterized by a wide, discordant complex with initial slurred positivity transitioning to a dominant negative deflection, consistent with ventricular pacing in the presence of the patient's pacemaker, where the activation sequence from a right ventricular lead produces a left bundle branch block-like configuration in lateral leads like aVL, potentially accompanied by secondary ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion in the terminal negative phase, though noise obscures precise interval measurements such as QRS duration exceeding 120 ms or QT assessment. The overall morphology points to dyssynchronous ventricular depolarization as the primary abnormality, without clear evidence of ischemic ST elevation or pathological Q waves in this brief segment, but the artifacts and extra beats complicate definitive exclusion of concurrent atrial or supraventricular influences.

The ECG in lead aVL shows ventricular paced rhythm with LBBB-like QRS morphology.
