The ECG recording in lead aVF captures a brief segment of electrical activity amid significant artifacts and a subsequent flatline, likely due to the noted baseline drift, noise, and electrode issues, but the initial 0.12 seconds reveal a distinct waveform morphology starting from a baseline near zero with an initial negative deflection reaching approximately -0.98 mV at 0.01 seconds, followed by a slight uptick to -0.03 mV at 0.02 seconds and a sharp positive spike to 1.03 mV at 0.03 seconds, representing the onset of ventricular depolarization; this is then followed by a rapid descent to -0.69 mV at 0.04 seconds, deepening to a prominent negative trough of -1.21 mV at 0.08 seconds before recovering toward 0.23 mV at 0.11 seconds, suggesting a triphasic QRS complex with an initial Q-like notch, tall R wave, and deep S wave, while the subsequent repolarization phase appears truncated but potentially initiates an upright T wave amid the noise. In the context of an elderly patient with a pacemaker and extra beats, this morphology in the inferior lead aVF—particularly the initial negative deflection of significant depth (nearly equal to the R wave amplitude) and duration approaching 30 ms—points to an abnormal QRS form characterized by a pathological Q wave, indicative of prior inferior wall myocardial infarction, as the Q wave exceeds typical benign criteria in size relative to the R wave and occurs in a lead sensitive to inferior pathology, though the poor signal quality and pacemaker presence could contribute to distortion or reflect a paced beat with altered conduction.
