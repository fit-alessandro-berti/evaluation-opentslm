The ECG time series provided exhibits significant challenges in interpretation due to the clinical context of an elderly patient with a pacemaker and noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, which complicate the identification of specific arrhythmias. Over the 10-second recording at 100 Hz, the vast majority of the data from 0.13 seconds onward consists of flat zero values across all 12 leads, suggesting either a technical failure in data capture, intentional truncation, or absence of ongoing electrical activity, leaving only the initial 0.12 seconds with meaningful deflections for analysis. In this brief segment, the voltage patterns show abrupt, high-amplitude swings—such as positive peaks around 0.665 mV at 0.01 seconds and 1.094 mV at 0.05 seconds in multiple leads, followed by sharp negative deflections reaching -1.049 mV at 0.11 seconds— that could represent QRS complexes, pacemaker spikes, or artifacts rather than organized cardiac cycles. Intervals appear irregular with no clear, repeatable P-QRS-T morphology; for instance, the rapid transitions from negative to positive values without evident preceding P waves or consistent narrow QRS durations (estimated <0.12 seconds based on sample timing) suggest noise or paced beats rather than premature supraventricular activity originating from atrial or AV nodal foci, which typically present as early beats with normal or near-normal QRS width and aberrant P waves. The pacemaker presence further raises the possibility of paced extrasystoles or interference, but the lack of distinct supraventricular features like inverted or absent P waves before a narrow QRS, combined with the overall poor fidelity and flatline after 0.12 seconds, precludes confident detection of supraventricular extrasystoles.
