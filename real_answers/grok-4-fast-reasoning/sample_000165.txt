The ECG recording for lead V6, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals a brief initial segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds with fluctuating voltages ranging from approximately -1.14 to +0.64 mV, exhibiting irregular deflections that lack clear P-QRS-T morphology and include sharp negative excursions around 0.06â€“0.11 seconds, suggestive of high-frequency static or burst noise superimposed on potential cardiac signals, possibly influenced by the noted pacemaker activity or extra beats, while a subtle downward trend in the negative values may hint at baseline drift; however, from 0.12 seconds onward, the signal abruptly flattens to zero voltage for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which deviates markedly from expected ongoing cardiac electrical activity in a precordial lead like V6, indicating a severe disruption consistent with electrode artifact such as detachment, poor contact, or lead failure rather than physiological variation. This combination disrupts reliable interpretation of intervals or abnormalities like ST segments or arrhythmias, underscoring poor signal quality overall. Electrode artifacts and burst noise.
