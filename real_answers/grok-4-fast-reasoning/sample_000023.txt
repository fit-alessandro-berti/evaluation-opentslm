The ECG signal, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, exhibits severe quality issues as noted, with baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats complicating interpretation, particularly in the context of a pacemaker in a young male patient. The time series displays non-zero deflections only in the initial 0.12 seconds, where leads show irregular voltage changes—such as negative deflections around -0.6 to -0.8 mV at 0.00 and 0.04 seconds, positive peaks up to 0.9 mV at 0.02 seconds, and subsequent smaller oscillations—likely representing artifactual noise or a single partial QRS-like complex rather than organized cardiac activity, with no discernible P waves, consistent PR intervals, or QRS morphology across leads. From 0.12 seconds onward, all leads remain flat at zero volts, indicating either recording failure, lead disconnection, or complete signal loss, preventing assessment of rate, regularity, or atrial activity over a meaningful duration. Atrial flutter would require visible sawtooth flutter (F) waves at 250-350/min, often in II, III, and aVF, with regular or variable ventricular response, but no such repetitive atrial pattern emerges amid the noise and flatline. Sinus arrhythmia, characterized by normal sinus P waves preceding QRS complexes with cycle length variation tied to respiration (typically <20% RR change in youth), cannot be confirmed due to the absence of multiple cycles or any identifiable sinus origin, though the brief irregular fluctuations could mimic mild respiratory variation if artifacts are discounted. The pacemaker presence suggests possible paced beats, but intervals like the short bursts do not align with typical pacing artifacts or either queried rhythm, rendering the trace largely uninterpretable for specific rhythm diagnosis.
