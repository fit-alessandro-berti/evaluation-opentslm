The provided ECG time series data for the 76-year-old male patient reveals a highly irregular and erratic pattern in lead V3 over the initial 0.12 seconds, with voltage amplitudes fluctuating sharply from -0.30637 mV at 0 s to a peak positive deflection of 0.69955 mV at 0.03 s, followed by rapid negative excursions reaching -1.40859 mV at 0.09 s, and no discernible organized morphology such as typical P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves that would indicate normal cardiac electrical activity; instead, these abrupt, high-amplitude changes suggest transient interference rather than physiological signals, especially considering the clinical note of burst noise presence alongside baseline drift, static noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in a paced rhythm. Subsequent to 0.12 s, lead V3 flattens to 0 mV across the entire 10-second recording, which is atypical for a functional ECG and further supports artifactual disruption rather than ongoing cardiac depolarization-repolarization cycles, with intervals impossible to measure accurately due to the lack of identifiable waveforms. This initial chaotic segment in V3 aligns with characteristics of burst noise, defined as short-lived, impulsive high-frequency disturbances often from mechanical or electrical sources, potentially exacerbated by the pacemaker and recording quality issues, without evidence of consistent rhythm or conduction abnormalities beyond the noise itself.

Yes, this ECG shows burst noise in lead V3.
