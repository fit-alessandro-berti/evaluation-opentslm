The provided ECG time series captures only a brief 0.12-second segment of cardiac activity before flattening to zero, likely due to recording artifacts, baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode issues noted in the clinical context, making full rhythm assessment challenging but allowing focus on the initial patterns suggestive of an extra beat in this 72-year-old female with a pacemaker. In lead II, which is key for rhythm analysis, the signal starts with a small positive deflection at 0.00 seconds (0.22 mV), quickly inverts to negative at 0.01 seconds (-0.16 mV), reaches a prominent deep negative peak at 0.02 seconds (-1.13 mV) indicative of a rapid ventricular depolarization, followed by a partial recovery with alternating small positive and negative waves through 0.11 seconds, lacking a clear preceding P wave and showing an abnormally wide or notched morphology consistent with aberrant conduction. Precordial leads like V1 exhibit a similar deep negative deflection at 0.02 seconds (-2.24 mV), supporting a ventricular origin rather than atrial, as supraventricular extrasystoles typically show narrower QRS complexes without such pronounced negativity in right-sided leads; the absence of consistent P-QRS-T progression and the presence of detected extra beats amid pacemaker activity further suggest this irregularity interrupts normal pacing or sinus rhythm. Intervals cannot be precisely measured due to the truncated data, but the abrupt onset and bizarre QRS shape, combined with noise artifacts, point to a premature ventricular event rather than atrial, as there is no evidence of early P wave or normal conduction. Premature ventricular contraction.

## Explanation

The reasoning process begins by reviewing the ECG data, noting its limitation to the first 0.12 seconds with subsequent zeros, attributed
