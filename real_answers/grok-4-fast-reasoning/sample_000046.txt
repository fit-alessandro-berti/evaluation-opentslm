The provided ECG data exhibits significant noise, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, as noted in the clinical context, along with evidence of a pacemaker, which complicates precise interpretation but allows for assessment of the overall QRS axis through examination of limb leads I and aVF across the available signal in the initial 0.11 seconds. The time series shows irregular deflections, with several potential QRS-like complexes amid artifacts; for instance, early positive deflections in lead I (e.g., 0.207 mV at 0.03 s and 0.388 mV at 0.06 s) and aVF (0.101 mV at 0.03 s and 0.433 mV at 0.06 s) suggest initial normal polarity, but interspersed negative excursions (e.g., -0.332 mV in aVF at 0.04 s and large negatives around 0.09-0.10 s likely representing pacemaker spikes or burst noise) indicate ventricular pacing morphology, where the mean QRS vector often shifts due to artificial activation from the right ventricular apex. Subsequent positives at 0.11 s (1.16 mV in both I and aVF) show upright complexes, but the dominant pattern, accounting for pacemaker influence and net deflections after excluding extreme artifactual negatives, reveals predominantly positive QRS in lead I with relatively negative or biphasic activity in aVF and inferior leads (e.g., II and III showing mixed but tending inferior negativity), consistent with a leftward shift of the frontal plane axis beyond -30 degrees, likely -45 to -60 degrees, reflecting left axis deviation typical in paced rhythms from right ventricular lead placement. Intervals are obscured by noise, but no clear ST abnormalities or other features alter this axis assessment.
