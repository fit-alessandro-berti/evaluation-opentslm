The ECG signal provided is limited to the initial 0.11 seconds of recording, with subsequent data flatlined at zero, likely due to recording artifacts or truncation, and the overall trace exhibits significant noise, baseline drift, and possible extra beats as noted in the clinical context, complicating precise morphology assessment; however, examining the limb leads reveals predominantly positive deflections in lead I across most samples, suggesting a leftward vector component, while lead aVF shows mixed but net positive activity with transient negative spikes potentially representing paced or ectopic beats, and the presence of a pacemaker typically implies ventricular pacing from the right ventricular apex, which characteristically produces a superior and leftward QRS axis due to the activation sequence starting from the apex and spreading toward the left ventricle, with intervals appearing prolonged and QRS morphology broad and discordant in the precordial leads consistent with paced rhythm rather than native conduction. Left axis deviation.
