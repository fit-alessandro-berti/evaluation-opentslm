The ECG time series reveals significant activity confined to the initial 0.12 seconds, with subsequent flatlining likely attributable to recording artifacts, baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode issues noted in the clinical context, limiting analysis to this brief segment in a 67-year-old female with a pacemaker and detected extra beats. Examining the limb leads (I, II, III) and augmented leads, there is an initial small deflection around 0.00-0.03 seconds suggestive of a T wave or repolarization phase, followed by a prominent positive spike in leads I and II at 0.01-0.02 seconds (peaking at ~0.45 mV), indicating possible atrial activity or early ventricular depolarization, but the morphology is narrow. At 0.05 seconds, another positive deflection occurs in I and II (~0.44 mV), potentially a sinus or paced P wave, but immediately transitioning to a large, broad negative complex in I and II from 0.06-0.09 seconds (reaching -2.27 mV in II), with prolonged duration implying a wide QRS morphology greater than 0.12 seconds, discordant ST segments, and no clear preceding P wave, while precordial leads V1-V6 show positive deflections in V1-V3 (~0.6 mV) contrasting with negative in limb leads, consistent with a leftward axis shift. This pattern suggests an early premature beat interrupting the baseline rhythm, originating below the AV node given the absence of consistent atrial linkage, wide bizarre QRS, and compensatory pause implied by the flatline post-event, distinguishing it from supraventricular extrasystoles which typically have narrow QRS and visible P waves; the pacemaker presence may indicate underlying conduction disease, but the extra beat's ventricular-like features dominate, pointing to a premature ventricular contraction as the extra systole type.

**Final Answer: Premature ventricular contraction (PVC)**
