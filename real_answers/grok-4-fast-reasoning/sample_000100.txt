No, this ECG does not show symptoms of right atrial overload/enlargement.

The ECG recording is severely compromised by extensive artifacts, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, and a predominance of zero values after the initial 0.11 seconds, rendering most of the 10-second trace uninterpretable and flat, likely due to recording failure or data issues rather than physiological silence, especially with a noted pacemaker that could suppress or alter native atrial activity. In the brief non-zero segment, lead II exhibits a positive deflection peaking at about 0.92 mV around 0.03 seconds, which might superficially resemble a tall P wave (>0.25 mV suggestive of RAE), but this is isolated, lacks context within a full PQRST complex, and is overshadowed by irregular fluctuations consistent with noise or extra beats rather than consistent atrial enlargement; similarly, V1 shows positive peaks of 0.62-0.70 mV in the 0.03-0.07 second range, potentially hinting at an increased initial P-wave amplitude (>0.15 mV for P pulmonale), yet these are too fragmented, without clear biphasic morphology or repeatable cycles, and could represent pacemaker spikes, artifacts, or non-specific noise in a 64-year-old male where age-related changes or pacing obscure native P waves. Overall, no reliable ECG criteria for right atrial overload—such as peaked P waves in II or V1, or increased P-wave duration—are evident amid the poor quality, precluding a positive diagnosis.
