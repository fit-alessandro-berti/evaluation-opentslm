The provided ECG time series captures only a brief initial segment of cardiac activity before flattening to zero, likely due to recording limitations or artifacts, but within this noisy window (0.00 to 0.11 seconds), the limb leads reveal irregular, fluctuating deflections consistent with the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in a 72-year-old patient with a pacemaker. Lead I shows mixed polarities, with positive peaks around 0.07 seconds (0.500 mV) and 0.04 seconds (0.313 mV) but negative excursions such as -0.283 mV at 0.02 seconds and -0.276 mV at 0.10 seconds, while lead aVF displays predominantly positive major deflections like 1.077 mV at 0.01 seconds and 0.780 mV at 0.00 seconds, interspersed with sharp negatives such as -1.140 mV at 0.03 seconds, suggesting possible ventricular ectopy or paced beats overriding intrinsic rhythm. The augmented leads (aVR negative overall, aVL variable but small, aVF mostly positive) and precordial leads (V1 to V6 showing high initial amplitudes in V1 at 0.930 mV transitioning to lower in lateral leads) hint at a vertical or inferior vector shift, but the pacemaker presence typically implies right ventricular pacing from the apex, which often produces left axis deviation by directing depolarization posteriorly and superiorly; combined with the artifacts obscuring clear QRS morphology and intervals (e.g., no reliable PR or QT assessment possible), the net QRS vector does not consistently align between -30° and +90°, as evidenced by the inconsistent positivity in I relative to aVF and the abnormal negative spikes indicating deviation. No, this ECG does not show a normal heart axis.
