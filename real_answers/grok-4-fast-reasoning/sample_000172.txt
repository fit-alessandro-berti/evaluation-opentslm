The provided ECG time series data for this 69-year-old female patient reveals a brief period of electrical activity in the initial 0.11 seconds across all 12 leads, characterized by sharp negative deflections around -1.3 mV in leads I and II at 0.01 seconds suggestive of possible Q waves or premature beats, followed by prominent positive peaks up to 1.1 mV in V1 at 0.03 seconds indicating R-wave-like morphology, and subsequent smaller oscillations that hint at partial QRS complexes or repolarization phases, but this activity abruptly ceases, with all leads flatlining at 0 mV from 0.12 seconds onward for the remaining 9.88 seconds of the 10-second recording. This pattern, combined with the clinical context of a pacemaker presence and detected extra beats, raises concerns for potential pacemaker malfunction such as failure to capture or undersensing, leading to asystole or ventricular standstill after initial irregular activity, while the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and overall poor signal quality further obscure interpretation and suggest technical recording issues that could mask or mimic true abnormalities like arrhythmias or conduction blocks; the irregular early morphology, including what appears to be supraventricular or ventricular ectopy based on the non-sinusoidal deflections and lack of consistent P-QRS-T progression, deviates from normal sinus rhythm expectations for a paced patient, where one would anticipate regular paced spikes and QRS captures throughout. Yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms, primarily indicative of recording artifact compounded by likely pacemaker-related dysfunction and possible bradyarrhythmia or ectopy.
