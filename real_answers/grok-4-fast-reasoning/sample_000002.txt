The initial segment of the ECG time series, spanning 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, reveals highly irregular voltage fluctuations across multiple leads, with lead II showing a progression from small negative deflections (-0.068 mV at 0.00 s) to brief positives (0.14 mV at 0.02 s), deeper negatives (-0.13 mV at 0.04 s), and then abrupt large swings (0.67 mV at 0.07 s to -0.64 mV at 0.08 s), followed by erratic positives and negatives up to -1.16 mV at 0.11 s, while other leads like III and aVF exhibit similar noisy patterns with amplitudes exceeding typical P wave heights (usually 0.1-0.25 mV). These observations, combined with the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and presence of a pacemaker in this 85-year-old patient, suggest that any atrial depolarization signal is obscured by artifacts, potentially mimicking or exaggerating a broad P wave morphology; the pacemaker likely indicates possible atrial pacing or sinus node dysfunction, which can prolong intra-atrial conduction, and the scattered deflections over roughly 110 ms without clear onset-to-offset definition imply delayed or dispersed atrial activation rather than a compact sinus P wave. In elderly patients, age-related fibrosis can further extend P duration beyond the standard 80-120 ms range, and here the noisy, prolonged-appearing atrial activity aligns with that abnormality.

Above the normal range.
