The ECG signal in lead V2, sampled at 100 Hz over the initial 0.11 seconds before flattening to zero, exhibits erratic fluctuations consistent with the noted poor signal quality, including baseline drift and burst noise, but the underlying morphology reveals a prominent negative deflection reaching -1.00177 mV at approximately 0.05 seconds, flanked by smaller positive excursions (up to 0.43005 mV at 0.04 seconds and 0.42555 mV at 0.06 seconds), suggestive of a wide, discordant QRS complex in a paced rhythm; given the patient's pacemaker, this pattern aligns with right ventricular pacing, producing a left bundle branch block-like morphology in the precordial leads, characterized by a delayed onset, slurred upstroke, and deep S wave without typical septal q wave, potentially indicating dyssynchronous ventricular activation; intervals cannot be precisely measured due to artifacts and truncation, but the absence of preceding P waves in the brief capture and detection of extra beats in the clinical context further support ventricular ectopy or pacing spikes obscured by noise, while the lack of sustained signal limits assessment of rate or T-wave abnormalities, emphasizing the need for repeat recording to confirm.

**Final answer: Left bundle branch block-like morphology due to ventricular pacing.**
