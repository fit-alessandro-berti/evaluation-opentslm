The provided ECG data for this 77-year-old female patient with a pacemaker reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, with meaningful signal confined to the initial 0.12 seconds before flattening to zero, suggesting a brief capture of cardiac activity amid technical limitations. The time series shows fluctuating voltages across leads, with an initial positive deflection in limb leads I, II, and III at time 0.00, followed by a transient negative spike in lead I and aVF around 0.03 seconds potentially indicating an early artifact or premature beat, then recovering to predominantly positive deflections culminating in a large positive peak at 0.11 seconds where lead I measures 4.26, aVF 2.42, II 4.26, and III 4.74, while aVR is positive at 2.46 (unusual but possibly noise-related) and aVL positive at 1.86. Precordial leads V1-V6 also show positive deflections peaking around 3 mV, consistent with ventricular activation directed anteriorly. Despite the pacemaker presence, which could alter morphology in paced rhythms (often causing left axis deviation in RV pacing), the dominant QRS-like complex appears positive in both lead I (0 degrees) and aVF (+90 degrees), placing the mean frontal plane axis in the normal quadrant (0 to +90 degrees) without clear evidence of deviation to left (I positive, aVF negative) or right (I negative, aVF positive); the brief duration and inconsistencies (e.g., violation of Einthoven's triangle) limit precise interval measurement but suggest no significant axis shift related to the observed patterns or abnormalities.
