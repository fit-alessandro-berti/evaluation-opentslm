The ECG recording is severely compromised by the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in the context of a pacemaker, resulting in an erratic time series with meaningful signal confined to the first 0.11 seconds before flatlining to zero, likely indicating a truncated or artifact-dominated trace rather than a full 10-second rhythm strip. Examining the limb leads for QRS morphology to assess the frontal plane axis, lead I shows predominantly negative deflections in early samples (e.g., -2.40 mV at 0.01 s and -2.56 mV at 0.02 s), transitioning to brief positive excursions (1.27 mV at 0.03 s and 1.33 mV at 0.04 s), followed by another negative peak (-3.04 mV at 0.05 s) and smaller positives/negatives thereafter, suggesting fragmented or paced QRS complexes with variable polarity; meanwhile, aVF mirrors some negativity (e.g., -2.08 mV at 0.01 s, -2.33 mV at 0.02 s, -2.70 mV at 0.05 s) but has positive components (1.04 mV at 0.03 s, 1.27 mV at 0.04 s, 1.36 mV at 0.06 s), while lead II and III display similar inconsistencies, with no clear isoelectric baseline to reliably measure net QRS deflection or duration. The pacemaker presence implies potential ventricular pacing, which commonly alters axis due to ectopic activation from the right ventricular apex, often producing left bundle branch block morphology with left axis deviation (QRS axis ≤ -30°), and the observed negative QRS trends in lead I without consistent positivity in aVF support this over a normal axis (+30° to +90°), as the noise-obscured patterns lack the equiphasic or positive balance in inferior leads expected for normal physiology; intervals are uninterpretable amid artifacts, but the overall morphology points to abnormal vector direction rather than physiologic normality. Left axis deviation.

## Explanation of AI Reasoning

The reasoning process begins by acknowledging the poor signal quality as described in the clinical context, which limits accurate analysis but does not preclude pattern recognition. It then focuses on the relevant limb leads (I, II, III, aVF) for axis determination, as these define the frontal plane vector per standard ECG guidelines (e.g., AHA/ACC criteria). Step-by-step evaluation involves scanning the non-zero samples for QRS-like deflections: negative peaks in lead I suggest a leftward or superior vector, while aVF's mixed but often negative or equivocal response indicates inferiority is not dominant, aligning with left axis deviation criteria (net positive in I but negative in aVF for mild cases, or overall ≤ -30°). The pacemaker context is integrated, as RV pacing typically shifts the axis leftward due to delayed left ventricular activation, supported by the erratic, non-sinusoidal morphology. This leads to the conclusion without prematurely stating it, ensuring the rationale flows naturally as a single paragraph before the final answer. The process avoids over-reliance on noisy data by prioritizing dominant trends and clinical correlation, consistent with expert ECG interpretation under suboptimal conditions.
