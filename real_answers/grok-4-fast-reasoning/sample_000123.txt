Examining the time series for lead I reveals an initial segment of extreme volatility with rapid, large-amplitude swings—starting at a positive deflection of about 1.05, plunging to -2.88 and even -6.03 within the first 0.12 seconds, interspersed with smaller rebounds like +1.63 and -0.55—that bear no resemblance to typical ECG components such as P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves, instead pointing to pronounced burst noise, static interference, and electrode motion artifacts, which are consistent with the reported poor signal quality and could be compounded by pacemaker spikes or extra beats disrupting the baseline. These irregular, non-physiological oscillations lack coherent morphology, suggesting unreliable capture of cardiac electrical activity rather than any definable rhythm or conduction abnormality, while the abrupt transition to a sustained flatline at zero from 0.12 seconds through the entire 10-second recording indicates complete signal loss, likely due to lead disconnection, severe baseline drift suppression, or recording failure specific to this lead. In an 82-year-old patient with a pacemaker, such patterns preclude accurate interval measurements or waveform analysis but highlight technical issues mimicking or obscuring potential cardiac symptoms.
