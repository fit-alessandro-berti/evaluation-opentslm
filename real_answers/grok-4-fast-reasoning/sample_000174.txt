The provided ECG time series captures only a brief 0.11-second segment of cardiac activity before flattening to zero, which is insufficient to delineate complete cardiac cycles or reliably identify T-wave morphology, especially given the noted poor signal quality with baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and pacemaker influence that can distort repolarization patterns. The initial fluctuations show irregular voltage shifts across leads, with positive deflections around 1-2.5 mV in most limb and precordial leads at 0.00-0.04 seconds potentially mimicking early depolarization, followed by negative excursions up to -3 mV suggestive of repolarization or artifactual noise rather than true T waves, particularly the abrupt large negative spikes in aVL (-3.12 mV) and aVF (-4.21 mV) at 0.10 seconds amid inconsistent lead relationships violating standard ECG vector rules, indicating electrode issues over physiological changes. These non-diagnostic irregularities, lacking symmetry, amplitude consistency, or clear ST-T correlation typical of specific pathologies like ischemia, align with non-specific T-wave alterations possibly exacerbated by the pacemaker's pacing artifacts and overall noise, affecting interpretation in leads where deviations from baseline are most pronounced without clear clinical correlation. No leads show definitive T-wave changes due to the truncated and noisy data, but the patterns suggest non-specific alterations in the limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF.

Final Answer: Limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF
