Examining the provided ECG time series for lead II, the signal over the initial 0.12 seconds reveals a brief but discernible cardiac cycle pattern amid noted artifacts like baseline drift and noise, with values transitioning from negative deflections around -0.94 mV at 0 s to a prominent positive peak of approximately 1.0 mV at 0.02 s, likely representing the R wave of the QRS complex, followed by a negative excursion to -1.12 mV at 0.04 s suggestive of an S wave, and then a series of positive undulations peaking at 0.79 mV at 0.06 s and 0.75 mV at 0.07 s, which align with the typical morphology and timing of a repolarization phase or T wave following the QRS; these positive deflections indicate an upright T wave rather than inversion, as inverted T waves would manifest as negative deflections post-QRS in lead II, potentially signaling ischemia or other pathologies, though the short duration and subsequent flatline from 0.12 s onward limit full assessment of rhythm or additional beats, and the presence of a pacemaker could influence morphology but does not appear to alter the observed upright pattern here; intervals are challenging to precisely measure due to the brevity and noise, but no clear abnormalities like prolonged QT or ST changes are evident in this snippet that would support T-wave inversion. No, this ECG does not show inverted T-waves in lead II.
