Upon examining the provided ECG time series data sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal non-zero voltages across all leads, while the remaining duration is uniformly flat at zero, likely representing a loss of signal due to electrode disconnection or recording failure rather than noise. Within the active segment, the limb leads demonstrate clear evidence of static noise through erratic, uncorrelated fluctuations that violate fundamental ECG relationships, such as Einthoven's triangle, where lead III should equal lead II minus lead I; however, discrepancies are substantial and consistent (e.g., at 0.02 s, II - I = 0 but III = -1.727 mV, a deviation of over 1.7 mV, and similar mismatches occur in every sample point with differences ranging from 0.08 to 1.73 mV). Leads I and II are identical across all points, which is physiologically implausible without right-arm or left-arm electrode interference introducing random broadband perturbations. The augmented leads are similarly affected, as aVF deviates markedly from its derivation ((II + III)/2; e.g., at 0.00 s, expected ~ -0.45 mV but observed 0.08 mV), and aVL exhibits exaggerated swings (from -5.08 mV at 0.06 s to 5.72 mV at 0.10 s) inconsistent with typical morphology, suggesting superimposed high-frequency static interference rather than true cardiac signal. In contrast, the precordial leads V1 through V6 display more coherent voltage transitions resembling possible QRS and T-wave elements (e.g., V1's progression from -3.49 mV at 0.00 s to 3.11 mV at 0.03 s and back to -3.68 mV at 0.04 s, indicative of R-wave activity in the right precordial position), with smaller identical values in V4-V6 at isolated points (e.g., 0.253 mV at 0.04 s) better explained by minor electrode artifacts than pervasive static noise. These patterns, combined with the noted baseline drift and extra beats potentially masked by noise, point to degraded signal quality primarily in the limb leads due to static noise from sources like electrical interference or poor contact, while the precordial leads retain interpretable cardiac features despite overall recording issues and the pacemaker's influence on rhythm. The leads showing static noise are I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF.
