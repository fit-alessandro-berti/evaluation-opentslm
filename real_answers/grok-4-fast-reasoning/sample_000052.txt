The provided ECG time series data for this 85-year-old female patient with a pacemaker reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which are compounded by the fact that the signal is essentially limited to the first 0.11 seconds with all subsequent values flatlining at zero, suggesting either a recording artifact or incomplete data capture rather than a full 10-second trace. In the initial segment, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) display fragmented deflections with mixed polarities: lead I starts negative (-0.61 mV at t=0.00) and briefly becomes positive (up to 0.83 mV at t=0.10) before returning negative, while lead II mirrors this pattern, and lead aVF shows predominantly negative initial values transitioning to positive spikes, but the brevity and noise prevent clear identification of complete QRS complexes or consistent ST-T waves. The precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit similar erratic, low-amplitude fluctuations without discernible P waves, QRS, or T waves, consistent with pacemaker activity potentially overriding intrinsic rhythm but obscured by artifacts. Axis determination relies on the net QRS vector in the frontal plane, typically assessed via leads I and aVF for deviation; here, the transient positive deflections in both suggest a possible rightward or inferior tilt, but the lack of sustained QRS morphology, combined with the pacemaker's influence that can artificially alter axis (often causing left or extreme deviation if ventricular pacing is involved), and the overwhelming flatline, precludes accurate calculation of the mean QRS axis using standard methods like the isoelectric lead or quadrant approach. Abnormalities such as extra beats may indicate ectopy or pacing spikes, but without a reliable QRS envelope, no definitive patterns emerge relating to hypertrophy, infarction, or conduction delays that might contribute to axis shift. Overall, the data does not support a reliable assessment of cardiac axis.

No, this ECG does not show extreme axis deviation.
