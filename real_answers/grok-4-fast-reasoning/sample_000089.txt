The ECG recording for this 55-year-old female patient with a pacemaker and extra beats reveals a brief segment of cardiac activity in lead aVF over the first 0.11 seconds, characterized by fluctuating amplitudes that likely represent P waves, QRS complexes, and possibly T waves or pacemaker artifacts, with intervals suggesting irregular rhythm due to the noted extra beats, though the short duration limits full assessment of rate or conduction abnormalities. The morphology shows sharp deflections, such as the drop from 1.47380 mV at 0.04 seconds to -1.52342 mV at 0.05 seconds, indicative of ventricular depolarization, followed by gradual repolarization trends, but without evident high-frequency random fluctuations that would suggest superimposed static noise like power line interference or broadband random signals. Instead, the signal abruptly transitions to a flat zero baseline from 0.12 seconds onward for the remaining 9.88 seconds, representing a sudden and sustained shift in the baseline level without any ongoing cardiac or noisy variations, which aligns more closely with baseline drift—potentially due to electrode movement, patient motion, or recording issues—rather than persistent static noise, as there are no small, erratic oscillations throughout the trace. This flatline abnormality obscures any further evaluation of intervals like QT or pacemaker capture but highlights signal instability related to the noted artifacts.

Final answer: baseline drift
