The ECG recording for this 82-year-old male with a pacemaker demonstrates severe signal degradation, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, resulting in meaningful electrical activity limited to the first 0.12 seconds across all 12 leads, followed by a 9.88-second flatline that suggests either a technical recording failure or profound conduction abnormality such as asystole despite pacing. In the initial segment, leads like II and V1 show irregular, high-amplitude deflections—such as the sharp negative spike around 0.06 seconds potentially indicative of a QRS complex or pacemaker artifact amid the noise—but no distinct P waves, complete QRS morphology, or identifiable T waves are discernible due to the brevity and contamination, making it impossible to isolate the onset of ventricular depolarization (Q wave) or the end of repolarization (T wave end). The pacemaker presence implies paced ventricular beats, which can alter QT morphology but typically fall within normal ranges unless influenced by electrolytes, drugs, or ischemia; however, the flatline absence of cycles precludes any reliable interval calculation, and the fragmented initial signal hints at no measurable repolarization phase, effectively rendering the QT unassessable rather than clearly short or prolonged.

The QT interval cannot be measured and falls in no standard range due to inadequate data.
