Examining the ECG time series for lead aVL reveals significant instability in the signal morphology right from the onset, with the baseline exhibiting abrupt and irregular deviations rather than a stable isoelectric line; for instance, the voltage starts at -0.24163 mV at 0.00 seconds, plummets to -2.02726 mV at 0.01 seconds, fluctuates wildly to +1.88073 mV by 0.03 seconds and back to -2.02038 mV at 0.05 seconds, then oscillates through values like +1.20763 mV, +1.08147 mV, +0.57080 mV, and -0.01993 mV over the next few samples, before settling into a flat zero line from 0.12 seconds onward. These rapid, non-physiologic shifts in the baseline, occurring within the first 0.12 seconds of the 10-second recording, suggest artifactual interference rather than true cardiac waveform patterns, as normal ECG intervals and morphologies (such as P-QRS-T complexes) would show more consistent, rhythmic deflections without such extreme, erratic wandering; the presence of extra beats and pacemaker activity noted in the clinical context could contribute to some variability, but the pronounced voltage swings in aVL align more closely with baseline instability caused by movement or poor electrode contact. While the signal flattens completely after the initial segment, potentially indicating a recording pause or data truncation, the early portion demonstrates clear non-stationarity in the baseline, consistent with drift superimposed on noise, which could obscure interpretation of any underlying cardiac rhythms or intervals like PR or QT in this lead. Yes, this ECG shows baseline drift in lead aVL.
