The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals substantial limitations in interpretability due to the clinical context of poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats in a patient with a pacemaker. The initial 0.12 seconds show irregular deflections across leads, with positive baseline shifts around 3.4-3.6 mV at t=0.00 potentially indicating isoelectric line or artifactual offset, followed by negative excursions in limb leads (e.g., -1.2 mV in I and II at t=0.01, -3.5 mV at t=0.02) and variable polarities in precordial leads, suggestive of noisy QRS-like complexes or paced beats rather than clear P-QRS-T morphology; however, from t=0.12 onward, all leads flatline at 0.00 mV, precluding analysis of intervals like PR, QRS duration, QT, or repolarization phases. This flatline dominates 98% of the recording, likely reflecting recording failure or suppression artifacts from the pacemaker or equipment issues, without discernible ST segment deviations, T-wave inversions, or Q waves necessary for diagnosis. In inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5-V6), no consistent ST elevation or pathological Q waves are evident to support myocardial infarction, while anterior leads (V1-V4) lack horizontal or downsloping ST depression or T-wave changes indicative of ischemia; the brief initial noise does not form diagnostic patterns and aligns more with artifacts than ischemic or infarct-related abnormalities. Overall, the ECG morphology and intervals cannot be reliably assessed, yielding no definitive diagnostic symptom for either condition.

Neither; the ECG is inconclusive due to poor signal quality and insufficient data.
