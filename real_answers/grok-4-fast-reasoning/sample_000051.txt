Examining the provided ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal highly irregular voltage fluctuations across all leads, with abrupt shifts from negative deflections around -0.28 mV in leads I and II at t=0.00 to positive peaks exceeding 1.0 mV in multiple precordial and limb leads by t=0.06, followed by sharp negative excursions to -0.59 mV at t=0.08, and then damping to near-zero levels; these patterns lack consistent P-QRS-T morphology, intervals, or rhythmicity expected in a physiological cardiac signal, instead suggesting non-cardiac interferences that distort the waveform, such as sudden high-amplitude spikes indicative of transient disruptions and erratic baseline shifts disrupting any potential cardiac cycles. The subsequent 9.88 seconds of complete flatline at 0.00000 mV across all leads further deviates from normal ECG variability, pointing to a loss of signal integrity rather than asystole or suppression, especially given the clinical note of a pacemaker, which should produce detectable paced rhythms if functioning. These abnormalities—irregular bursts, wandering baseline, and prolonged isoelectric periods—align with artifactual overlays rather than true extra beats or paced activity, as the lack of repetitive QRS-like features or pacing spikes amid the chaos implies external influences compromising lead contact and signal stability, ultimately rendering the trace uninterpretable for cardiac diagnosis without re-recording.

The ECG shows baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts.
