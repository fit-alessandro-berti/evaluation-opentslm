The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift and noise in the initial 0.12 seconds, with all subsequent values flatlining at zero, suggesting an incomplete or artifact-dominated recording that limits comprehensive analysis; however, the visible deflections in the limb leads show predominantly negative initial QRS-like patterns in lead I (e.g., values around -0.8 to -1.1 mV early on, with brief positive excursion at 0.03 s but returning negative), while lead II and aVF display mixed but relatively more positive net deflections amid the noise (e.g., +1.17 mV in II at 0.03 s and +0.91 mV in aVF), and the presence of a pacemaker in this young patient points to likely ventricular pacing from the right ventricular apex, which characteristically alters the frontal plane axis by directing the depolarization vector leftward and superiorly due to the late activation of the left ventricle; extra beats and artifacts further obscure morphology, but the overall pattern in the limb leads, combined with pacing context, indicates no rightward shift and instead a superior-left orientation of the mean QRS axis, without evidence of normal or right deviation. Left axis deviation.
