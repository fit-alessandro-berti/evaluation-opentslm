The provided ECG time series captures only a brief 0.12-second segment of signal before flattening to zero, likely due to the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, making comprehensive analysis challenging, but the visible patterns in the limb leads can still be assessed for axis determination amid the pacemaker-influenced rhythm, which often produces abnormal vectors from right ventricular pacing. In lead I, the deflections show an initial negative excursion around 0.02-0.06 seconds reaching -1.75 mV, followed by a prominent positive peak at 0.09 seconds of +3.46 mV, suggesting a predominantly positive QRS morphology despite noise. Lead aVF exhibits variable polarity with negative values early (-2.13 mV at 0.01 seconds) and a positive peak of +1.73 mV at 0.09 seconds aligning with lead I's positive phase, while leads II and III show large swings (e.g., III positive at +3.55 mV at 0.00 seconds then negative, II mirroring I initially), indicative of erratic but not consistently superior or northwest-oriented vectors. The augmented leads (aVR negative overall, aVL mixed) further support a frontal plane axis that, using a rough estimation from net positive deflections in I and aVF (arctan(aVF/I peak ratio ≈ arctan(1.73/3.46) ≈ +26 degrees), falls within normal range (0 to +90 degrees) rather than extreme left (-90 to -180 degrees) or right (+90 to +180 degrees), though artifacts obscure full complexes and intervals like PR/QRS/QT, potentially masking subtle deviations from pacing or extrasystoles. No clear isoelectric lead or reversed polarity in both I and aVF is evident to indicate extreme deviation.

No, this ECG does not show extreme axis deviation.
