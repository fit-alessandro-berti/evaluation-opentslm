The ECG recording exhibits substantial signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, compounded by the presence of a pacemaker, which complicates precise interval measurement but points toward artificial pacing influencing conduction. The time series data is limited to non-zero activity in the first 0.12 seconds across all leads, with flatlining thereafter, suggesting either a truncated capture or recording failure beyond an initial segment containing at least one cardiac cycle; in leads like II and V1, irregular deflections emerge from 0.01-0.02 s with negative troughs (e.g., -0.50 mV in II, -0.43 mV in V1), transitioning to positive peaks around 0.03-0.06 s (up to 1.34 mV in II and 1.25 mV in V1), followed by notching and return to baseline by 0.08-0.10 s, indicative of ventricular depolarization amid noise. These patterns suggest a QRS complex spanning roughly 70-90 ms in the visible morphology, but the pacemaker's role in overriding normal conduction typically broadens the complex due to ectopic ventricular activation, often incorporating fragmented or slurred components not fully resolved here due to artifacts; extra beats may further distort timing, yet the overall morphology aligns with paced QRS characteristics rather than narrow sinus rhythm, implying conduction delay. Considering standard criteria adjusted for pacing and poor quality, the QRS duration falls in the range of 120-160 ms.
