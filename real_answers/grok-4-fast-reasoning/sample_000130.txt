The time series for lead II reveals a brief period of activity in the first 0.12 seconds with voltage fluctuations ranging from approximately -0.87 mV to +0.66 mV across the initial samples, exhibiting rapid ups and downs that align with potential cardiac waveforms influenced by the noted pacemaker and extra beats, but these variations appear irregular and high-frequency, suggestive of superimposed static noise from electrical interference and burst noise from transient spikes, while subtle slower shifts in the baseline during this segment hint at baseline wander possibly due to patient movement or respiration; abruptly, from 0.12 seconds onward, the signal flattens completely to zero for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which deviates sharply from expected ECG morphology and indicates a profound electrode artifact, such as poor contact or lead disconnection, disrupting the entire recording and preventing reliable assessment of intervals or abnormalities like QRS complexes or pacemaker capture beyond the initial burst. This ECG shows baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts in lead II.
