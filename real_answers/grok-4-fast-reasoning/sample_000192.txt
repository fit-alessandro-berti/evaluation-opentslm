The provided ECG recording is severely limited by its short duration of meaningful signal, spanning only the first 0.12 seconds with non-zero values across the 12 leads, followed by 9.88 seconds of flat zero baseline, which aligns with the noted poor signal quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detection of extra beats during what must have been a brief capture, compounded by the presence of a pacemaker that likely dictates the depolarization pattern rather than intrinsic conduction. In this initial segment, the deflections show biphasic patterns with prominent positive amplitudes in leads I (up to approximately 5.14) and aVF (up to about 1.37), alongside positive values in II and III but negative in aVR, suggesting that if these represent QRS complexes—potentially paced given the clinical context—the overall vector appears directed inferiorly and to the left, consistent with a normal frontal plane axis between 0° and +90°; however, the noisy, artifact-laden morphology prevents clear delineation of P waves, QRS intervals, or ST segments, and the pacemaker's influence often results in altered or non-physiologic axis deviations such as left axis shift depending on ventricular lead placement, while the absence of further cardiac cycles renders the trace uninterpretable for confirming sinus rhythm or stable axis throughout the recording. No, this ECG does not show a normal heart axis due to insufficient data and pacing artifacts precluding reliable assessment.
