The provided ECG time series, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals a strikingly limited useful signal, with non-zero voltages confined to the initial 0.12 seconds across all leads, transitioning abruptly to flatline (zero values) thereafter, which strongly suggests significant recording artifacts, electrode detachment, or data truncation rather than a complete cardiac trace. In this brief initial segment, the voltages in leads like II and V1 exhibit irregular fluctuations—starting with positive deflections around 2-3 mV followed by sharp negative excursions to -3.4 mV and then smaller positive waves—lacking the characteristic P-QRS-T morphology of normal sinus beats, and instead resembling baseline drift, burst noise, or pacemaker spikes amid the noted poor signal quality issues. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the brevity and irregularity, but no clear premature wide-complex QRS complexes (typical of ventricular extrasystoles, often >120 ms with discordant ST changes and no preceding P wave) are discernible; the patterns appear chaotic and non-physiologic, potentially masking or mimicking extrasystoles in the context of the pacemaker and detected extra beats, yet without sustained rhythm to assess coupling intervals, compensatory pauses, or ventricular origin. Overall, the abnormalities point more to technical failure than interpretable arrhythmia, complicating definitive identification of ventricular extrasystoles.

No, this ECG does not show ventricular extrasystoles.
