The provided ECG time series data for lead V4 reveals a pattern of noise characterized by a gradual, low-frequency wandering of the baseline, as evidenced by the initial segment showing a smooth progression from -0.27698 mV at 0.00 seconds to 0.37113 mV at 0.03 seconds, then to -0.15154 mV at 0.05 seconds, and further to -0.77568 mV at 0.06 seconds, before flattening to zero values from 0.12 seconds onward, which is typical of baseline drift caused by factors like patient movement, respiration, or electrode issues in an 85-year-old with noted artifacts and a pacemaker; this slow, undulating shift contrasts with static noise, which would manifest as high-frequency, random fluctuations or consistent broadband interference across the signal, not observed here in the limited active portion of V4. The overall ECG morphology in the early seconds suggests possible premature beats or pacemaker spikes superimposed on this drift, but the noise in V4 specifically aligns with low-frequency baseline instability rather than erratic static interference, potentially obscuring subtle ST segment or T-wave details if the drift were more pronounced throughout the recording.

Final answer: baseline drift
