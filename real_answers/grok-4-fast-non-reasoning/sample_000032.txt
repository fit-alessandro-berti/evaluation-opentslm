The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of extra beats, which complicate precise interpretation, particularly in an 84-year-old patient with a pacemaker that may alter intrinsic rhythms or suppress certain arrhythmias. Examining the initial 0.12 seconds of recording across leads, there are clear deflections suggestive of cardiac activity: small initial negative waves in leads I, II, and III around 0.00-0.03 seconds, followed by prominent positive QRS-like complexes peaking at approximately 0.05 seconds with amplitudes up to 1.09 mV in II and V1-V6, and subsequent T-wave patterns with negative deflections by 0.08-0.11 seconds, indicating at least one or two conducted beats with normal morphology for sinus rhythm, though the pacemaker presence suggests these could be paced or intrinsic. The abrupt large negative spike at 0.11 seconds in multiple leads, reaching -1.05 mV, followed by zeros from 0.12 to 9.99 seconds, likely represents an artifact from electrode movement or recording interruption rather than a true premature beat, as no P-wave, QRS, or repolarization morphology is discernible for classification as supraventricular in origin, and the clinical note of extra beats detected during recording does not align with visible supraventricular extrasystoles (such as premature atrial contractions with narrow QRS and similar ST-T changes) in the usable signal. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to noise and the truncated data, but the absence of early P-waves or aberrant narrow complexes after the initial activity points away from supraventricular extrasystoles, potentially favoring ventricular ectopy, pacemaker artifacts, or simply uninterpretable noise in this short capture.

No, this ECG does not show supraventricular extrasystoles.
