The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a large deflection at approximately 0.11 seconds across all leads, suggesting possible motion artifact or an extra beat, but the vast majority of the 10-second recording (from 0.12 seconds to 9.99 seconds) consists of zero-valued signals in all 12 leads, which is not representative of a typical clinical ECG and likely indicates a recording failure or data transmission error rather than interpretable cardiac activity. Prior to this artifact, the initial 0.11 seconds show fluctuating amplitudes in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6, with notable negative deflections in limb leads (e.g., -1.023 mV in II at 0.07 s) and large positive QRS-like complexes in precordial leads (e.g., 5.72 mV in V5 at 0.00 s, dropping to -5.70 mV in V5 at 0.06 s), but these are too brief and noisy to reliably identify P waves, QRS morphology, or consistent intervals for rhythm assessment, especially given the presence of a pacemaker that could alter native conduction patterns. The lack of ongoing signal prevents clear differentiation between sinus rhythm, which would require regular P waves preceding QRS complexes with a rate of 60-100 bpm, and a bigeminal pattern, characterized by alternating normal and premature beats (supraventricular or ventricular in origin) leading to grouped beating; however, the clinical note of "extra beats detected during recording" and the abnormal initial deflections point toward irregular rhythm disturbances rather than steady sinus activity. Overall, the poor signal quality and absent data render a definitive rhythm diagnosis impossible, but the documented extrasystoles in the context of pacemaker presence and artifacts suggest a bigeminal pattern is more likely than pure sinus rhythm.

Final answer: bigeminal pattern (unknown origin, supraventricular, or ventricular)
