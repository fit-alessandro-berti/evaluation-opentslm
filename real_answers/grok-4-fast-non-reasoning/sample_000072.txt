The provided ECG time series data reveals significant abnormalities right from the outset, with the initial 0.12 seconds showing erratic voltage fluctuations across all 12 leads, including large negative deflections in leads I, II, and III (reaching -2.268 mV at 0.02 seconds) and pronounced positive spikes in precordial leads V1 to V3 (up to 6.15 mV), suggestive of premature ventricular contractions or extra beats as noted in the clinical context, rather than the smooth, rhythmic P-QRS-T morphology expected in a normal sinus rhythm. These patterns lack consistent P waves, exhibit irregular QRS complexes with variable durations and amplitudes, and show no clear isoelectric baseline after 0.12 seconds, where the signal abruptly flattens to zero across all leads for the remaining 9.88 seconds, indicating either a recording artifact, equipment failure, or interruption rather than ongoing cardiac electrical activity. The presence of a pacemaker, combined with reported baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, further complicates interpretation, as paced rhythms typically display distinct spike artifacts followed by wide QRS complexes, but here the noise obscures any reliable assessment of intervals like PR, QRS, or QT, and the overall lack of a complete, artifact-free cardiac cycle precludes identification of normal axis, rate (estimated irregularly around 300-500 bpm in the brief active segment, far exceeding normal 60-100 bpm), or morphology. In a 70-year-old patient, such features point to underlying conduction issues or device malfunction rather than physiological normality.

No, this is not a normal ECG.
