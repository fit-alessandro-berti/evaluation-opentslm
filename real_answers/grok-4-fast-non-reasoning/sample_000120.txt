The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which complicate precise morphological analysis, particularly in the presence of a pacemaker that likely influences depolarization patterns. Nonetheless, examining the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) for axis determination, the initial QRS complexes show a positive deflection in lead I (e.g., at 0.03 s: +1.03 mV, 0.04 s: +2.43 mV) and a more pronounced positive deflection in lead aVF (e.g., at 0.04 s: +1.52 mV, 0.08 s: +2.61 mV), suggesting the mean QRS vector aligns toward the inferior-left quadrant of the frontal plane, consistent with a normal axis between 0° and +90°. Subsequent data points after 0.12 s are predominantly zeroed out, likely due to recording artifacts or data truncation, limiting assessment to the early segment, but no clear evidence of predominantly negative QRS in lead I combined with positive in aVF emerges to indicate right axis deviation (> +90° or ≤ -30°); instead, the pacemaker's effect may normalize or left-shift the axis in this 71-year-old female, with noise potentially exaggerating small deflections but not altering the overall positive polarity in key leads. Therefore, this ECG does not show right axis deviation.

**Final Answer:** No
