The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker presence, which obscure clear interpretation of cardiac rhythms across all leads; the initial 0.12 seconds show some fluctuating voltages suggestive of early cardiac activity or noise in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6, with patterns like a positive deflection at 0.03 seconds potentially mimicking a P wave or QRS complex, but the abrupt transition to zero voltage from 0.12 to 9.99 seconds across all leads indicates either a recording artifact, equipment failure, or intentional data truncation rather than ongoing physiological signal. In a 23-year-old male with a pacemaker, extra beats could represent paced rhythms or native ectopy, but supraventricular extrasystoles (such as premature atrial contractions) would typically manifest as early P waves (possibly abnormal morphology) followed by narrow QRS complexes with normal or slightly altered intervals (PR < 200 ms, QRS < 120 ms) and compensatory pauses, yet the absence of discernible waveforms beyond the initial segment prevents reliable identification of such featuresâ€”no consistent P-QRS-T sequences, irregular R-R intervals, or aberrant morphologies are evident amid the noise and flatline. The pacemaker likely influences the rhythm, potentially suppressing or overriding native supraventricular activity, but without amplitude spikes characteristic of pacing artifacts (e.g., narrow pulses in V1-V3), it's challenging to differentiate paced beats from true extrasystoles. Overall, the poor signal quality and lack of interpretable patterns preclude a definitive assessment of supraventricular extrasystoles.

Final answer: No
