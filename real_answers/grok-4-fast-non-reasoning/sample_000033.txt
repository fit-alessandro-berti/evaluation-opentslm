The provided ECG time series data shows significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detection of extra beats, which complicate precise measurement of the P wave duration; additionally, the presence of a pacemaker suggests potential pacing artifacts or altered atrial activation that could influence P wave morphology. Examining the initial 0.12 seconds of the recording, where the only non-zero deflections occur, reveals small positive deviations in leads I, II, aVL, and aVF around 0.03–0.04 seconds (approximately 0.8–1.3 mV), consistent with atrial depolarization in a standard 12-lead ECG setup, while the subsequent QRS-like complexes at 0.05–0.06 seconds (negative in limb leads, positive in precordials) and T wave at 0.07–0.09 seconds indicate a complete cardiac cycle before noise and artifacts dominate the trace. The P wave appears narrow, spanning roughly 0.02–0.03 seconds (2–3 small squares at 100 Hz sampling, equivalent to 80–120 ms), falling within the normal range for atrial conduction in a 57-year-old male without overt intra-atrial delay, though the pacemaker and noise prevent definitive exclusion of subtle prolongation; no clear evidence of broad or notched P waves suggestive of left atrial enlargement or other abnormalities is discernible in the limited clean segment.

The P duration falls in the range of 80–120 ms.
