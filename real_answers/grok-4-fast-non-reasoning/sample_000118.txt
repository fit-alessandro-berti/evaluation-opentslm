The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a large segment of zero values from approximately 0.12 to 9.99 seconds, which likely indicates recording artifacts or technical failure rather than physiological silence, limiting the analysable portion to the initial 0.12 seconds. In this short window, the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show irregular deflections with negative voltages transitioning to positive peaks, such as a prominent upward spike around 0.02-0.03 seconds in lead II reaching about 0.6 mV, followed by a sharp negative excursion in V4-V6 exceeding -1 mV at 0.04 seconds, suggestive of premature ventricular depolarization rather than normal sinus rhythm, especially given the clinical note of extra beats and a pacemaker. The morphology in precordial leads displays wide, discordant patterns with no clear P waves preceding the complexes, short coupling intervals relative to expected paced or sinus beats, and abnormal ST-T changes, pointing to ventricular origin of the extra systole; the presence of a pacemaker complicates interpretation but does not alter the aberrant QRS-like features consistent with ectopy from the ventricles rather than atrial or junctional sources. Intervals cannot be precisely measured due to noise and brevity, but the abrupt, bizarre configuration without compensatory pause aligns with ventricular extrasystoles, potentially pacemaker-mediated or intrinsic in this elderly patient.

**Final answer: Premature ventricular contraction (PVC)**
