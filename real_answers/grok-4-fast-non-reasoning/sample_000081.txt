The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of a pacemaker, which complicates interpretation, but the initial 0.12 seconds of data prior to the flatline segment shows clear evidence of irregular cardiac activity suggestive of extra systoles. Examining the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6), the voltage deflections exhibit non-uniform patterns: for instance, at 0.02 seconds, there is a prominent positive spike in multiple leads (e.g., II at 0.45 mV, V5 at 1.64 mV), likely representing a normal QRS complex, followed by a brief return toward baseline, but subsequent points at 0.03-0.05 seconds display smaller, aberrant deflections (e.g., negative in V6 at -0.63 mV and positive in V1 at 0.29 mV) with shortened intervals between peaks compared to typical sinus rhythm, indicating premature ventricular contractions or atrial extrasystoles interrupting the regular cycle. The morphology in augmented leads like aVL and aVF shows inconsistent polarity shifts, and the presence of extra beats as noted in the clinical context aligns with these early irregularities, where the RR interval appears abbreviated before noise and artifacts obscure further detail; the pacemaker may be influencing rhythm but does not preclude superimposed extrasystoles, as the initial patterns deviate from paced uniformity. Overall, these abnormalities in timing, amplitude, and lead concordance point to ectopic beats rather than solely artifactual noise.

Yes, this ECG shows extra systoles, likely premature ventricular or supraventricular in origin.
