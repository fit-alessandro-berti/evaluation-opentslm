The provided ECG time series data for this 79-year-old male patient reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, which complicate precise morphological assessment, particularly in the precordial leads like V4 where pacemaker activity may also alter repolarization patterns. Focusing on the initial 0.12 seconds of recording, which contain the only non-zero signal values across all leads, the V4 channel shows a sequence of deflections: an initial negative value at -1.167 mV (0.00 s), followed by a positive peak at 0.346 mV (0.01 s), a high positive at 1.486 mV (0.02 s), a drop to 0.504 mV (0.03 s), a deep negative at -1.505 mV (0.04 s), a positive at 1.088 mV (0.05 s), a decline to 0.419 mV (0.06 s), 0.494 mV (0.07 s), a sharp rise to 1.725 mV (0.08 s), a small positive at 0.429 mV (0.09 s), a negative at -0.194 mV (0.10 s), and a rise to 0.797 mV (0.11 s), before flattening to zero. This pattern suggests an abbreviated QRS-T complex with a prominent positive T-wave component, likely the peak around 1.725 mV following the main ventricular deflection, indicating normal or even augmented amplitude rather than low, as T-wave amplitude in V4 is typically considered low if below 0.1-0.2 mV in adults, but here it reaches over 1.7 mV, potentially exaggerated by noise, artifacts, or pacemaker influence on ventricular repolarization. The absence of data beyond 0.12 seconds limits full cycle analysis, but the observed T-wave morphology in V4 does not align with low amplitude characteristics such as flattening or inversion below 0.1 mV, which might suggest ischemia or electrolyte issues in this elderly patient.

No, this ECG does not show symptoms of low amplitude T-wave in lead V4.
