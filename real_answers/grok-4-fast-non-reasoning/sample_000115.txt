The provided ECG time series data captures only the initial 0.12 seconds of recording before flattening to zero, which is insufficient for a complete analysis of cardiac rhythms or intervals over the full 10 seconds, but the visible portion reveals significant abnormalities consistent with the clinical context of a pacemaker presence and noted artifacts. Starting with lead II as a standard reference, the signal shows irregular deflections: an initial small positive wave at 0.00 s (approximately 0.16 mV), followed by a sharp negative excursion to -1.86 mV at 0.02 s, then a positive rebound to 0.94 mV at 0.04 s, a negative dip to -1.33 mV at 0.05 s, a small negative at 0.06 s, and progressive positive waves building to 1.15 mV at 0.10 s, with a final negative shift at 0.11 s; these patterns suggest paced ventricular beats characterized by abrupt, high-amplitude spikes typical of pacemaker artifacts, rather than natural sinus rhythm, with irregular morphology likely due to the detected extra beats and electrode artifacts. Intervals cannot be precisely measured due to the short duration and noise (baseline drift, static and burst noise), but the lack of consistent P-QRS-T sequences and presence of discordant deflections across leads (e.g., V1 showing escalating positives from 0.40 mV to 1.26 mV) point to atrioventricular dissociation or ventricular pacing capture, without clear evidence of intrinsic atrial activity. Excluding uncertain features like potential premature beats obscured by noise, the ECG demonstrates definitive signs of pacemaker-mediated rhythm and associated artifacts disrupting normal conduction.

**Diagnostic symptoms:** Pacemaker rhythm, electrical artifacts (electrode, noise), extra beats.
