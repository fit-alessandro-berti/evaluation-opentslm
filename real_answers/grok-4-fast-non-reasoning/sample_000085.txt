The provided ECG time series data reveals only the initial 0.12 seconds of recording with meaningful signal variations across the 12 leads, followed by approximately 10 seconds of flatline (zero values), which is consistent with the noted poor signal quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, rendering the majority of the trace uninterpretable for standard analysis; however, in the available segment, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show initial negative deflections in lead I (starting at -1.08 mV and -0.84 mV), transitioning to positive in lead II (up to 1.17 mV at 0.03 s) and aVF (peaking around 0.91 mV), while aVR is predominantly negative and aVL mixed but leaning negative, suggesting a net inferior axis orientation where the mean QRS vector points downward toward the +II and +aVF directions rather than leftward or superiorly, though the pacemaker presence and artifacts preclude definitive interval measurements or morphology assessment for confirming conditions like left or right axis deviation beyond this directional inference from the early patterns.

**Final answer: Inferior**
