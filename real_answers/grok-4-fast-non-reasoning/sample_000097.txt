The provided ECG time series data reveals a brief recording period from 0.00 to 0.12 seconds with non-zero voltage values across all leads, followed by approximately 9.88 seconds of flat zero lines, suggesting either a truncated or artifact-dominated trace beyond the initial segment, consistent with the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats in an 84-year-old male with a pacemaker. Baseline drift typically manifests as slow, wandering deviations in the isoelectric line due to factors like patient movement, poor electrode contact, or respiratory influences, which can obscure true cardiac morphology and intervals; in this short initial window, the limb leads (I, II, III) exhibit notable low-frequency fluctuationsâ€”for instance, lead I starts at 0.825 mV and drops sharply to -0.990 mV by 0.02 seconds before partially recovering, while lead II mirrors this pattern and lead III shows similar undulating shifts from 0.935 mV to -0.840 mV, indicating possible drift from electrode instability. The augmented leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) display comparable irregular baseline shifts, with aVR varying from 0.716 mV to -0.538 mV and aVF from 0.679 mV to -0.665 mV, potentially exacerbated by the pacemaker's electrical interference or artifacts. In contrast, the precordial leads (V1 to V6) show more stable but still subtly drifting patterns, such as V1 fluctuating mildly from 0.424 mV to 0.125 mV without the pronounced swings seen in limb leads, though noise and extra beats may contribute to minor deviations; overall, these patterns suggest the drift is most evident in the frontal plane leads, complicating assessment of intervals like PR or QT and any pacemaker spikes, but the flatline post-0.12 seconds precludes further analysis there. The leads showing baseline drift in this ECG are I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF.
