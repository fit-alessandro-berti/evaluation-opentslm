Examining the provided ECG time series data for lead II, which represents the electrical activity from the right arm to the left leg and is typically used to assess inferior cardiac views, I note that the recording spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz but contains substantial artifacts including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, and detected extra beats, alongside a pacemaker presence that could alter normal repolarization patterns; the initial 0.12 seconds show meaningful deflections, with a prominent positive peak at 0.02 seconds (0.99624 mV, likely a QRS complex), followed by a gradual decline through 0.06 seconds (0.78649 mV), a slight dip at 0.07 seconds (0.74580 mV), and then a negative excursion reaching -0.45128 mV at 0.08 seconds and -0.94184 mV at 0.09 seconds, before returning toward baseline by 0.11 seconds (-0.55482 mV), suggesting a T-wave that is predominantly upright (positive) after the QRS but with a possible terminal inversion or biphasic component influenced by noise or the pacemaker's pacing artifact, as the negative phase occurs post-QRS in what appears to be the repolarization interval; however, the overall morphology does not demonstrate a clearly and consistently inverted T-wave throughout, as the initial post-QRS segment remains positive, and the brief negativity may reflect artifact rather than a pathologic inversion, which in a young female could indicate ischemia, electrolyte issues, or strain if truly present, but the poor signal quality limits definitive interpretation without visual confirmation or filtered tracing. No, this ECG does not show symptoms of inverted T-waves in lead II.
