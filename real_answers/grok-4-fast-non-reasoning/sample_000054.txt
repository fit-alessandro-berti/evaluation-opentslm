The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in accurate analysis due to poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker presence, which complicates the identification of clear R-wave peaks in the QRS complexes across leads like II or V1, where RR intervals are typically measured. The initial 0.12 seconds of data show fluctuating amplitudes suggesting possible cardiac activity, such as potential QRS deflections around 0.02 s (positive in lead II) and 0.07 s (prominent positive in multiple leads), but the subsequent flatline from 0.12 s to 10 s indicates no reliable signal, likely an artifact or recording error rather than true asystole, especially with the pacemaker noted in the clinical context, which might imply paced rhythms or failure to capture not evident here. Extra beats are mentioned but not discernible in this truncated active segment, and the noise obscures precise interval measurement; estimating from the visible fluctuations, the apparent distance between potential R-peaks is roughly 0.5 seconds, corresponding to an RR interval of about 500 ms, though this is speculative given the artifacts and lack of full waveform morphology to confirm normal sinus rhythm, pacing spikes, or arrhythmias like bradycardia or ectopy that could alter the range. Overall, the poor quality prevents definitive assessment of cardiac condition beyond suggesting possible irregular or paced rhythm disrupted by technical issues.

Final answer: 500 ms
