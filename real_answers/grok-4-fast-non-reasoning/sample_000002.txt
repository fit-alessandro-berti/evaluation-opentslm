The provided ECG data shows only the initial 0.12 seconds of recording with non-zero signal values across the 12 leads, followed by a prolonged flatline (all zeros from 0.12 to 10 seconds), which is insufficient for a complete analysis of atrial depolarization patterns, as a standard 10-second ECG is required to reliably measure P wave duration. The brief segment exhibits irregular deflections and artifacts, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts as noted in the clinical context, with no clear P waves identifiable due to the pacemaker presence and extra beats detected, which can alter or suppress native atrial activity. In paced rhythms, especially in an 85-year-old patient, P waves may be dissociated or absent, making duration measurement challenging or irrelevant, and the noise further obscures any potential morphology. Without discernible P waves in a representative cardiac cycle, the P duration cannot be accurately assessed against the normal range of 80-120 ms.

The P duration falls in a range that cannot be determined from this incomplete and artifact-laden recording.
