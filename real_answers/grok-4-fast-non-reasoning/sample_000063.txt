The provided ECG time series data appears to be severely compromised by technical artifacts, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, and a significant segment of flatline (zero values) from approximately 0.12 to 9.99 seconds, rendering most of the 10-second recording uninterpretable for standard diagnostic analysis. However, the initial 0.12 seconds of data shows discernible cardiac electrical activity across the 12 leads, with negative deflections in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF suggesting possible atrial or ventricular repolarization phases or inverted P waves, followed by positive spikes in multiple leads (e.g., up to 1.57 mV in I and II at 0.03 s, and broader positives in precordial leads V1-V6), which could indicate paced QRS complexes given the clinical note of a present pacemaker; these patterns align with artificial pacing artifacts rather than native sinus rhythm, as the morphology lacks typical progressive R-wave transition in precordials and shows synchronized deflections consistent with ventricular pacing. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to noise and brevity, but the absence of clear P-QRS-T sequences and presence of extra beats noted in the recording suggest irregular or paced ectopy; no definitive ST elevation, Q waves, or axis deviation is evident in the limited clean segment, though artifacts obscure potential ischemia or hypertrophy signs. Overall, the ECG demonstrates paced rhythm with technical interference precluding full assessment, but the diagnostic hallmark is the presence of pacemaker spikes and non-native conduction.

Final answer: Pacemaker rhythm with artifacts.
