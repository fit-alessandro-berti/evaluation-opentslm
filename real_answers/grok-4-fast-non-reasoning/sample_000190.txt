The provided ECG time series data reveals significant artifacts and noise, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which complicate interpretation, particularly in the initial 0.12 seconds where non-zero deflections are observed across multiple leads (e.g., prominent positive spikes in lead II at 0.01 s and 0.05 s, negative deflections in aVR and V1, and anomalous large positives in V5 and V6 around 0.06-0.09 s), followed by a prolonged flatline from 0.12 s to 10 s, suggesting either recording failure or post-processing suppression of signal. In a 75-year-old male with a pacemaker, the early irregular patterns could represent paced rhythms or intrinsic beats, but the clinical note explicitly mentions extra beats detected during recording, indicating premature ventricular contractions or supraventricular extrasystoles that disrupt the expected regular pacing intervals; however, the poor signal quality and absence of clear QRS morphology, PR/QRS intervals, or consistent RR variability in the usable portion make definitive identification challenging without visual tracing, though the noted extrasystoles align with abnormalities in timing and amplitude that deviate from sinus or paced normality. Overall, the presence of pacemaker spikes (potentially masked by noise) and detected extra beats suggest arrhythmogenic activity beyond standard pacing.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows extrasystoles.
