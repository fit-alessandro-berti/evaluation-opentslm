### Analysis of ECG Time Series

The provided 10-second ECG data at 100 Hz sampling rate reveals a very brief capture of cardiac electrical activity primarily in the initial 0.12 seconds, with all leads showing synchronized deflections that suggest a paced rhythm, consistent with the clinical note indicating a pacemaker presence. Starting at t=0, lead I exhibits a small initial positive deflection (0.05759 mV), followed by a sharp positive spike at t=0.01 (1.03923 mV) and a peak at t=0.02 (1.86351 mV), then a negative trough at t=0.04 (-1.01570 mV); similar patterns appear across limb leads (II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF), with II and III mirroring I's morphology but with varying amplitudes, indicating a ventricular depolarization wave propagating in a leftward and inferior direction, typical of right ventricular pacing where the QRS complex is wide and positive in inferior leads. Precordial leads V1 to V6 show more heterogeneous responses, with V1 displaying a deep negative deflection at t=0 (-0.34196 mV) transitioning to positive spikes (e.g., 0.80882 mV at t=0.01) and V3-V5 showing prominent negative peaks around t=0.04 (e.g., -2.00393 mV in V3), suggesting a left bundle branch block-like morphology often seen in RV-paced beats due to delayed left ventricular activation. Intervals are challenging to precisely measure from this short segment, but the rapid upstroke and duration from t=0 to t=0.05 approximate a QRS width exceeding 120 ms, with no clear P waves visible, pointing to atrioventricular sequential pacing or ventricular pacing without atrial capture. From t=0.12 seconds onward, all leads flatline at 0.00000 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which, given the noted signal quality issues (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts), likely reflects recording artifacts or equipment failure rather than true asystole, though the absence of further beats aligns with detected extra beats and potential pacemaker malfunction. This pattern suggests underlying bradyarrhythmia necessitating pacing, but the flatline raises concern for intermittent capture failure or lead issues, though definitive intervals (PR, QT) cannot be assessed due to the limited active signal.

### Diagnostic Symptoms
- **Definite**: Pacemaker rhythm with wide QRS complexes consistent with ventricular pacing (likely right ventricular lead placement), poor signal quality with artifacts obscuring full interpretation, extra beats (implied by clinical note but not clearly visible in this segment).
- **Uncertain**: Possible pacemaker non-capture or failure to pace after initial beat, given the prolonged flatline; potential baseline wander or complete signal loss due to artifacts rather than true cardiac arrest; unclear atrial activity or AV synchrony due to short capture duration. Recommend repeat ECG with improved lead placement for confirmation.
