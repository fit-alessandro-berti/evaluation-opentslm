The provided ECG time series data spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz sampling rate, but the signal is predominantly flat at zero amplitude from 0.12 seconds onward across all 12 leads, with only a brief initial segment (0.00 to 0.11 seconds) showing some voltage fluctuations consistent with possible cardiac activity, though heavily compromised by noted artifacts including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, extra beats, and a pacemaker's influence. In this short non-flat portion, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) display irregular deflections without clear, consistent P waves preceding QRS complexes, and the precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit small, variable spikes that could represent paced ventricular beats or noise, but the irregularity in timing and morphology—coupled with the absence of organized atrial activity—raises suspicion for chaotic atrial impulses typical of atrial fibrillation; however, the extreme brevity of usable signal (less than one full second), overwhelming artifacts, and pacemaker presence make it impossible to reliably assess RR interval variability, fibrillatory waves (f waves), or atrioventricular dissociation needed for a definitive diagnosis, as pacemakers can mask or mimic AF patterns by enforcing ventricular pacing. Overall, while the limited visible irregularity hints at possible AF, the poor signal quality and technical limitations prevent confident interpretation, suggesting the need for a repeat ECG with better recording conditions to evaluate atrial rhythm properly.

Final answer: No, this ECG does not clearly show symptoms of atrial fibrillation due to insufficient usable signal and artifacts.
