Examining the ECG time series for lead II, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal fluctuating voltage values such as -0.29989 mV at 0.00 s, dropping to -0.82712 mV at 0.01 s, rising to -0.52226 mV at 0.02 s, peaking at 0.62101 mV at 0.03 s, and then varying through 0.10277 mV, -0.81091 mV, and 0.23045 mV by 0.06 s, indicative of cardiac waveform morphology including potential P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves disrupted by artifacts, but these rapid, irregular shifts suggest superimposed high-frequency interference rather than smooth low-frequency wandering; from 0.12 s to 9.99 s, the signal flattens to a constant 0.00000 mV, eliminating any ongoing ECG activity or noise in this segment, though the clinical context notes baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts across the recording, with extra beats and a pacemaker potentially contributing to irregularities in the early portion. The observed patterns in lead II, particularly the abrupt, erratic deviations in the first 0.12 seconds without gradual undulations, point to static noise as the dominant artifact rather than baseline drift, which would manifest as slower, wandering shifts in the isoelectric line.
