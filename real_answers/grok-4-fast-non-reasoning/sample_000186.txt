The provided ECG time series data reveals significant issues that preclude a reliable assessment of the QT corrected interval. From the initial 0.12 seconds, there are discernible deflections in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6, suggesting the onset of cardiac electrical activity, but immediately afterward, all leads flatline to zero amplitude for the remaining 9.88 seconds of the 10-second recording. This absence of ongoing signal—despite the clinical note of a pacemaker, extra beats, and various noise artifacts—indicates a failure in data capture, possibly due to equipment malfunction, electrode detachment, or post-processing error during the AT-60 recording, rendering the ECG essentially unreadable beyond the first few samples. Without identifiable QRS complexes, T waves, or measurable RR intervals for heart rate correction (e.g., via Bazett's formula for QTc), it's impossible to accurately measure the QT interval or determine if it falls within the normal range (typically 350-440 ms for females, adjusted for rate). The presence of a pacemaker might further complicate interpretation by altering repolarization patterns, but the lack of usable waveform data overrides any such consideration.

The QT corrected interval cannot be assessed due to insufficient ECG signal.
