The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker, which collectively obscure the identification of clear P waves necessary for accurately measuring P duration; the initial 0.12 seconds show some deflections in leads like II and V1 that might suggest atrial activity, but these are fragmented and inconsistent across leads, with subsequent data flattening to zero, likely due to recording errors or data truncation, preventing reliable detection of P wave onset and offset. Normal P duration in adults is typically 80-120 ms (0.08-0.12 s), reflecting normal intra-atrial conduction, but the noise and pacemaker (which may suppress or alter native P waves) make it impossible to discern a consistent P morphology or duration from the visible patterns, as there are no well-defined biphasic or upright P waves in standard limb leads to analyze for broadening or shortening indicative of abnormalities like left atrial enlargement (prolonged >120 ms) or hypercalcemia (shortened <80 ms). Extra beats detected further complicate rhythm assessment, but no clear atrial depolarization patterns emerge to suggest a specific condition affecting P duration. Given the poor signal quality and inability to identify any measurable P waves, the P duration cannot be determined as falling above or below the normal range.

Final answer: unable to determine due to poor signal quality.
