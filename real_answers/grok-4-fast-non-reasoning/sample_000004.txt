The provided ECG time series data reveals significant issues right from the outset, with the first 0.12 seconds showing irregular voltage fluctuations across multiple leads, including small positive deflections in leads I and II (peaking around 0.06-0.07 seconds), negative shifts in aVR, aVL, and aVF, and notably deep negative deflections in the precordial leads V1 through V6, suggesting possible ST-segment depression or T-wave inversions that could indicate ischemia or strain, though the brevity of the recording limits full assessment of rhythm. From 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly flatline to zero voltage for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which is highly abnormal and incompatible with normal cardiac electrical activity, as a standard ECG should display ongoing P-QRS-T complexes at a rate of 60-100 per minute for a 10-second trace; this persistent isoelectric line points to technical failure rather than physiological silence, exacerbated by the noted artifacts, noise, baseline drift, and extra beats. The presence of a pacemaker in the clinical context might explain some irregularities if malfunctioning, but the complete signal loss after initial activity strongly suggests electrode detachment, poor contact, or recording error rather than a true cardiac pathology like asystole, though urgent re-recording is warranted to rule out underlying abnormalities. Overall, yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms primarily due to poor signal quality and absence of interpretable cardiac waveform beyond the initial segment.

Final answer: Yes.
