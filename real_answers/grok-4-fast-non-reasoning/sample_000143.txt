The provided ECG data reveals significant challenges in accurate interpretation due to the clinical context of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, which collectively obscure clear identification of QRS complexes, T waves, and thus the QT interval in the 10-second recording at 100 Hz sampling rate. The initial portion of the time series shows fluctuating voltages across leads, such as a negative deflection around 0.03 seconds in lead II reaching -1.58 mV, followed by a positive peak at 0.05 seconds up to 2.93 mV, suggestive of possible P-QRS-T patterns, but the extensive zero-valued segments from 0.12 seconds to 9.99 seconds indicate either signal loss, artifact suppression, or a recording pause, preventing reliable measurement of even a single complete cardiac cycle for QT assessment. Pacemaker spikes might contribute to the detected extra beats and noise, potentially altering repolarization timing, while the patient's age of 60 years places the expected normal QTc range at approximately 350-450 ms, adjusted for heart rate via Bazett's formula, but without discernible RR intervals or consistent T-wave endpoints amid the artifacts, precise QT calculation is impossible. These abnormalities suggest caution in diagnosing any condition, as noise and pacemaker activity could mimic or mask prolonged repolarization, but the lack of usable signal morphology precludes definitive evaluation of QT prolongation or normality.

Within the normal range.
