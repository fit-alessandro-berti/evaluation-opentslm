The provided ECG time series data reveals a truncated recording limited to the initial 0.12 seconds, with subsequent samples filled with zeros, which severely limits the ability to perform a comprehensive analysis of cardiac rhythm, intervals, or morphology over the full 10-second duration. In lead aVL specifically, the visible signal from 0.00 to 0.12 seconds exhibits small-amplitude deflections, starting with a positive value of 1.174 mV at 0.00 s that quickly inverts to negative peaks around -1.03 mV at 0.03 s and -2.10 mV at 0.06 s, followed by a brief positive uptick to 0.285 mV at 0.11 s before flattening; these patterns suggest possible P-wave or early QRS-like activity but are confounded by the noted artifacts, baseline drift, and static/burst noise, potentially mimicking or obscuring form-related abnormalities such as fragmented or notched waveforms indicative of conduction delays. The presence of a pacemaker in the clinical context implies paced beats, which could alter QRS morphology in aVL to show wide, discordant deflections if ventricular pacing is dominant, but the short non-zero segment does not capture full complexes or extra beats to confirm such features like slurring or notching that might relate to left ventricular strain or ischemia in this high lateral lead. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the data truncation, and the noise further complicates identification of subtle form changes, such as those seen in left anterior hemiblock or bundle branch patterns, ultimately rendering definitive assessment challenging without additional signal.

No form-related symptoms are discernible in lead aVL due to insufficient data.
