The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, exhibits significant artifacts and noise, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, which severely compromise the interpretability of the signal beyond the initial 0.11 seconds where non-zero values are recorded. In those early moments, the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show fluctuating voltages with prominent negative deflections reaching approximately -3.8 mV in lead II at 0.11 seconds, suggestive of possible large QRS complexes or pacing spikes consistent with the noted pacemaker presence, while augmented leads like aVR display inverted patterns typical of standard ECG morphology; however, the abrupt transition to flat zero lines from 0.12 seconds onward indicates a recording failure or equipment issue rather than a true isoelectric cardiac state. Without discernible P waves, consistent ST segments, T waves, or Q waves across multiple cycles, and given the limited valid data, it's impossible to identify classic infarction patterns such as hyperacute T waves (early stage), ST elevation (acute), Q wave formation with ST resolution (evolving), or persistent Q waves with T wave inversion (old). The pacemaker further complicates analysis, as paced rhythms can mask or mimic ischemic changes, and the extra beats add irregularity, but no clear evolutionary signs of myocardial infarction—such as territorial ST shifts in contiguous leads—are evident in the brief noisy segment. Overall, the poor signal quality precludes a definitive assessment of infarction stage.

No infarction stage can be determined due to insufficient and corrupted data. Recommend re-recording the ECG for accurate evaluation.
