The provided ECG time series data reveals a very limited recording duration with meaningful signal, primarily in the first 0.1 seconds, where the limb and precordial leads show small amplitude deflections suggesting possible P waves or early QRS components, followed by negative excursions that could indicate T waves or artifacts, but the values are predominantly near zero or flatlined from 0.12 seconds onward, rendering the trace essentially unanalyzable for diagnostic purposes due to the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, all of which obscure any reliable morphology assessment. In the context of a 61-year-old male with a pacemaker, the initial patterns do not demonstrate characteristic features of myocardial infarction such as ST-segment elevation, Q waves, or T-wave inversions in contiguous leads indicative of middle-stage evolution (typically involving evolving ST changes or Q-wave development 6-24 hours post-onset), and the pacemaker presence further complicates interpretation without full paced rhythm visualization, as pacing spikes or capture are not clearly discernible amid the noise. Intervals cannot be accurately measured given the truncated and artifact-laden data, and no abnormalities like reciprocal changes or hyperacute T waves are evident in the brief segment, suggesting the recording is insufficient to evaluate for infarction.

No, this ECG does not show the middle stage of myocardial infarction.
