The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges for accurate analysis due to extensive baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a large segment of zero-valued signals from approximately 0.12 to 10 seconds, which likely indicates recording issues or data truncation, leaving only the initial 0.12 seconds of usable signal. In this brief window, the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show small deflections consistent with paced QRS complexes, as the patient's clinical context confirms a pacemaker presence, typically manifesting as wide, abnormal morphology spikes without preceding P waves in paced rhythms. The augmented leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) also display erratic patterns, but the noise obscures clear P waves, PR intervals, or QT durations. Extra systoles are noted in the context, suggesting premature beats interrupting the rhythm, and given the paced baseline, these would likely appear as non-captured or aberrant beats with altered morphology compared to the regular paced QRS, potentially from atrial or ventricular origins, though the artifacts prevent precise measurement of coupling intervals or post-extrasystolic pauses to distinguish supraventricular from ventricular types.

The ECG shows ventricular extrasystoles, likely in the form of premature ventricular contractions superimposed on the paced rhythm.
