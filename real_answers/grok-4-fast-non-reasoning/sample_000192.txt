The provided ECG time series data is severely limited, containing only 12 data points of actual signal (from 0.00 to 0.12 seconds) before transitioning to flatlines of zero amplitude for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which suggests a recording artifact or data truncation rather than a complete 10-second trace, compounded by the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and pacemaker presence that could distort interpretation. Within the initial segment, the limb leads show some deflections: lead I exhibits biphasic patterns with positive peaks around 3.57 mV at 0.00 s and 5.14 mV at 0.04 s interspersed with negative excursions to -2.00 mV and -4.57 mV, indicating variable polarity; lead II largely mirrors lead I with similar amplitudes and phases, suggesting upright QRS-like complexes in both; lead III displays smaller, more variable deflections (e.g., 1.22 mV positive at 0.00 s, -2.93 mV at 0.02 s, 2.76 mV at 0.04 s), showing both positive and negative components; and augmented leads like aVF also reflect this mixed polarity with positives around 1.11 mV and negatives to -1.11 mV. These patterns hint at a cardiac axis that may deviate from normal (typically -30° to +90°, where both I and aVF are predominantly positive), as the inconsistent polarities in III and aVF, combined with the pacemaker's influence potentially altering ventricular depolarization vectors and the presence of extra beats, point toward possible left or right axis deviation, though the noise and incomplete data prevent precise quadrant-based calculation (e.g., via net QRS areas, which can't be reliably computed from so few points). Overall, the morphology suggests abnormal conduction or pacing artifacts affecting axis alignment, but definitive assessment is hindered by poor signal quality and truncation.

No, this ECG does not show a normal heart axis.
