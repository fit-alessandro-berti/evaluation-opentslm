The provided ECG time series data reveals significant issues with signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker presence, which collectively obscure clear interpretation of the cardiac waveform morphology and intervals across the 12 leads over the 10-second recording at 100 Hz. The initial 0.12 seconds show fluctuating amplitudes in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF, with negative deflections in I and II (e.g., -0.61 mV at t=0, dropping to -0.90 mV at t=0.07), while aVF displays more negative values (e.g., -0.72 mV at t=0, -0.99 mV at t=0.07), and aVL also negative, suggesting a possible left axis deviation pattern where the mean QRS vector points away from lead I and toward aVF; however, the presence of extra beats and pacemaker spikes further distorts the QRS complexes, making it challenging to identify consistent P waves, PR intervals, or ST segments without additional filtering or full waveform visualization. After t=0.12 seconds, the signal flatlines to zero across all leads for the remaining 9.88 seconds, likely due to recording artifact or data truncation, preventing assessment of ongoing rhythm or axis stability. In standard ECG analysis, extreme axis deviation (typically left axis > -90° or right axis < -90°/ > +90°) is determined by the net QRS deflection in limb leads, but the noise, artifacts, and incomplete data here preclude definitive measurement using methods like the quadrant approach or isoelectric lead reference, though the early negative patterns in I and aVL hint at potential leftward shift possibly influenced by the pacemaker or age-related conduction changes in this 85-year-old patient.

No, this ECG does not show extreme axis deviation, as the poor signal quality and flatline prevent reliable axis calculation.
