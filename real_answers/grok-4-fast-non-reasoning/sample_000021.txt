The provided ECG time series data reveals a brief 0.12-second segment of cardiac activity from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, characterized by fluctuating voltages across leads consistent with a single QRS complex—marked by an initial positive deflection in limb leads I, II, and aVF suggesting atrial depolarization, followed by deep negative deflections in multiple leads indicative of ventricular depolarization, and subsequent positive waves in precordial leads V1-V6 implying repolarization—before abruptly flattening to zero voltage for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which aligns with the noted poor signal quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats detected during recording, compounded by the presence of a pacemaker that may have suppressed or overridden intrinsic rhythm capture in this 10-second window. These patterns point to an underlying paced rhythm where the device likely delivers artificial stimuli to maintain cardiac output, potentially masking natural sinus activity, while the abrupt signal loss suggests technical failure in recording rather than a true asystolic event, though the detected extra beats could represent premature ventricular contractions or pacemaker-mediated extrasystoles disrupting regularity. Overall, the morphology and sudden cessation imply intermittent capture issues or artifactual interference rather than sustained arrhythmia, but in a young patient, this could correlate with symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, or fatigue from unreliable pacing.

This ECG shows symptoms of paced rhythm with possible intermittent loss of capture and artifacts mimicking rhythm instability.
