I'm sorry, but the provided ECG data appears to be incomplete or corrupted, as it contains only a brief segment of meaningful signal in the first 0.1 seconds followed by extensive periods of zero values across all leads, which doesn't represent a standard 10-second 12-lead recording suitable for detailed analysis. This, combined with the noted signal quality issues like baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, makes it impossible to reliably identify T-wave morphology or any specific abnormalities such as non-specific T-wave changes. Non-specific T-wave changes typically involve flattening, inversion, or low amplitude without clear ischemic or electrolyte etiology, but without a clear QRS-T complex in the data, I can't evaluate intervals, ST segments, or T-wave patterns in individual leads. A full, clean ECG recording would be needed for an accurate assessment.

Final answer: Unable to determine due to insufficient data.
