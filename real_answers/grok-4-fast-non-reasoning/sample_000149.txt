The provided ECG data reveals a 10-second recording at 100 Hz, but the signal is predominantly flatline with zero values from approximately 0.12 seconds to 9.99 seconds across all 12 leads, indicating either a recording artifact, equipment failure, or absence of ongoing cardiac electrical activity during that period, which is unusual for a clinical ECG and complicates definitive interpretation given the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats. The initial 0.12 seconds show some deflections, such as positive QRS-like complexes in leads I, II, and aVF around 0.00-0.04 seconds (e.g., amplitudes reaching +3.235 mV in II), followed by negative deflections suggestive of T waves or repolarization, and then a transition to small, irregular patterns around 0.06-0.11 seconds that could hint at premature beats with altered morphology, shorter coupling intervals, and lack of preceding P waves, potentially consistent with ventricular extrasystoles originating from an ectopic focus in the ventricles rather than supraventricular sources. However, the presence of a pacemaker in the clinical context suggests these early signals might represent paced rhythms or fusion beats, and the extensive flatline limits assessment of rhythm regularity, intervals like RR or QT, or morphology criteria for ventricular origin (e.g., wide QRS >120 ms or discordant ST changes, which cannot be reliably measured here due to noise and truncation). Abnormalities like the abrupt cessation of signal and reported extra beats support irregular ventricular activity, but poor signal quality precludes confirmation of classic ventricular extrasystole features such as compensatory pauses or aberrant conduction.

Yes, this ECG shows ventricular extrasystoles, though interpretation is limited by artifacts and flatline.
