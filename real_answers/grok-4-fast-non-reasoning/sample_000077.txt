The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of a pacemaker, which complicates precise interpretation, but the initial 0.12 seconds of recording in leads I, II, and III show a clear premature beat at approximately 0.11 seconds, characterized by a narrow QRS complex of short duration (around 80 ms, estimated from the rapid deflection), consistent with supraventricular origin, and occurring earlier than expected in the cardiac cycle following the preceding QRS, suggesting a ventricular pause afterward due to non-compensatory timing; the morphology aligns with the patient's underlying rhythm without significant aberration or wide complex features typical of ventricular ectopy, and the pacemaker's influence appears minimal in this segment as no pacing spikes are evident in the visible data. This pattern, in the context of an 84-year-old with extra beats detected, points to a supraventricular extrasystole rather than a ventricular one, likely originating from atrial or atrioventricular junctional tissue.

**Final answer: Supraventricular extrasystole**
