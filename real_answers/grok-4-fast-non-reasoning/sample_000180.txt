The provided ECG time series data spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz sampling, but the majority of the recording from 0.12 seconds onward consists of zero values across all 12 leads, indicating either a recording artifact, equipment failure, or an incomplete dataset rather than a full clinical ECG trace. Focusing on the initial 0.12 seconds of meaningful signal, the patterns in leads I, II, and III show small deflections with amplitudes ranging from approximately -1.23 mV to +0.41 mV, while precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit even smaller variations, often below 0.1 mV in magnitude, consistent with the noted poor signal quality including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats. These low-voltage signals suggest diminished electrical activity, particularly evident in the T-wave regions following presumed QRS complexes (e.g., around 0.03-0.06 seconds where positive deflections occur), where repolarization phases appear flattened or barely discernible rather than prominently inverted, biphasic, or peaked. The presence of a pacemaker, as mentioned in the clinical context, may contribute to altered morphology, but the overall low amplitudes in T-waves across multiple leads point to reduced signal strength rather than specific morphologic distortions like inversion or excessive peaking that would characterize a broader T-wave abnormality. Given the question's focus on form-related symptoms, the dominant feature is the notably low amplitude of the T-waves, likely exacerbated by the recording artifacts and patient factors.

Final answer: low amplitude t-wave
