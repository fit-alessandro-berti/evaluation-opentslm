The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in accurate analysis due to poor signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker, which can distort ventricular depolarization patterns and make precise measurement of intervals like QRS duration difficult; additionally, the data appears truncated or padded with zeros after the initial 0.12 seconds, limiting the number of cardiac cycles available for examination, though the early non-zero segment shows irregular deflections suggestive of paced rhythms with extra beats. Examining the visible waveform in leads such as V1 and V2, which are typically useful for QRS assessment in paced ECGs, the patterns indicate broad, abnormal ventricular complexes characteristic of pacemaker activity, where the QRS often reflects asynchronous ventricular capture rather than normal conduction; the morphology shows initial small deflections followed by larger, slurred positive or negative spikes spanning roughly 0.08 to 0.10 seconds in the visible portion, consistent with ventricular pacing that bypasses the His-Purkinje system, leading to delayed and prolonged activation. Abnormalities like the detected extra beats and noise further obscure exact onset and offset points, but the overall morphology aligns with prolonged conduction times often seen in paced hearts, where QRS widening results from artificial stimulation sites, potentially indicating underlying conduction disease in this 55-year-old male. Given these observations, the QRS duration falls in the range of 100-120 ms.

**Final Answer:** 100-120 ms
