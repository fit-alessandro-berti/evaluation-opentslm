The provided ECG time series data reveals significant issues right from the outset, with only the first 0.12 seconds containing non-zero signal values across the 12 leads, showing irregular deflections that suggest possible premature ventricular contractions or extra beats as noted in the clinical context, followed by a prolonged flatline (all zeros) for the remaining 9.88 seconds, which is highly atypical for a standard 10-second cardiac recording at 100 Hz sampling rate. This flatline pattern, combined with the reported baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and presence of a pacemaker, indicates severe signal acquisition problems rather than reliable cardiac electrical activity, making it impossible to accurately assess ECG morphology such as P-wave presence, QRS complex shape, ST segments, or T-wave inversions that could point to abnormalities like ischemia, arrhythmias, or conduction delays. The initial brief signals in leads I and II show large amplitude variations (e.g., positive peaks up to 4.95 mV and negative troughs to -4.46 mV), potentially hinting at paced rhythms or artifacts from poor lead placement, but without sustained waveform patterns, no definitive intervals like PR, QRS duration, or QT can be measured to evaluate for prolonged conduction or repolarization issues common in a 68-year-old patient. Overall, the data's quality precludes a standard interpretation, but the artifacts and incomplete recording themselves represent abnormal technical symptoms that could mask or mimic true cardiac pathology, warranting a repeat ECG for proper diagnosis.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms, primarily due to poor signal quality, artifacts, and an incomplete flatline recording suggestive of technical failure rather than a clear cardiac rhythm.
