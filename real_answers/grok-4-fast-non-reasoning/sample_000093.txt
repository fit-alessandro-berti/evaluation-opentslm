The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, reveals significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of a pacemaker, which collectively complicate precise interpretation but do not obscure the core patterns relevant to detecting extra systoles. Examining the leads, particularly II and V1 which are useful for rhythm assessment in paced rhythms, the initial 0.12 seconds show irregular deflections suggestive of cardiac activity: a small negative deflection in lead II at around 0.01-0.02 seconds followed by a positive spike at 0.03 seconds, then another negative in lead II at 0.05-0.06 seconds with a compensatory pause-like pattern before a more regular positive wave at 0.06-0.07 seconds, and subsequent smaller waves up to 0.11 seconds indicating possible premature beats amid noise. These early irregularities in R-R intervals—shorter than typical paced or sinus intervals of 0.6-1.0 seconds—align with extra systoles, such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), especially given the clinical note of detected extra beats and the pacemaker's potential to capture or allow native ectopic activity. The morphology in precordial leads (V1-V6) shows broad, paced-like QRS complexes with secondary T-wave inversions, but the abrupt early complexes deviate from a uniform paced rhythm, supporting ectopic origins rather than artifacts alone, though noise could mimic some features. Beyond 0.12 seconds, the signal flattens to zero, likely due to recording truncation or technical failure, limiting full analysis, but the initial segment's patterns, intervals shorter than expected (e.g., ~0.04 seconds between potential beats), and clinical context point to arrhythmogenic activity.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows extra systoles, likely premature ventricular contractions superimposed on a paced rhythm.
