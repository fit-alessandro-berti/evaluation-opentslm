Examining the ECG time series data for lead aVL reveals a pattern of irregular fluctuations in the signal amplitude over the initial seconds of recording, starting with small negative values around -0.02 mV at time 0.00 s, plunging to approximately -2.03 mV at 0.01 s, followed by slight variations near -1.95 mV at 0.02 s, then rising sharply to positive peaks of about 1.88 mV at 0.03 s and 1.66 mV at 0.04 s, before dropping again to around -2.02 mV at 0.05 s and stabilizing somewhat at lower amplitudes like 1.21 mV at 0.07 s and 0.57 mV at 0.08 s, with a brief near-zero level at 0.12 s onward. These abrupt shifts in the baseline level, unrelated to typical cardiac waveform morphology such as P-QRS-T complexes or pacemaker spikes, suggest low-frequency wandering or drifting of the isoelectric line, which is characteristic of baseline drift artifact, potentially exacerbated by the noted overall signal quality issues including electrode artifacts and the presence of a pacemaker that could contribute to unstable recordings. While the data beyond 0.12 s flattens to zero, indicating possible recording cessation or data truncation, the early irregular undulations in aVL confirm the presence of this artifact without evidence of confounding cardiac abnormalities directly impacting the assessment.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows baseline drift in lead aVL.
