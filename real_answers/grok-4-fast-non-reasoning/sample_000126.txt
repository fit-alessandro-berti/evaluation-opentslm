The provided ECG time series reveals significant artifacts and irregularities that strongly suggest electrode problems, as evidenced by the initial 0.12 seconds of data showing erratic voltage fluctuations across multiple leadsâ€”such as I and II displaying identical values (-0.56128 mV at t=0, then 0.03427 mV and 0.75876 mV shortly after), which violates expected limb lead relationships in a standard Einthoven triangle configuration, while augmented leads like aVR and aVL exhibit inconsistent derivations and V1-V6 show sporadic spikes amid noise. These patterns align with the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts in the clinical context, where poor contact or loose electrodes can cause non-physiological wandering, sudden jumps, and superimposed interference that obscure true cardiac waveforms like P, QRS, and T components. From t=0.12 seconds onward, all leads flatline to exactly 0.00000 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, indicating a complete loss of signal acquisition, likely due to total electrode detachment, cable disconnection, or equipment failure rather than a pathological cardiac standstill, especially given the presence of a pacemaker and detected extra beats earlier, which would typically produce ongoing electrical activity. Such prolonged flatlining across all 12 leads is not consistent with normal or abnormal cardiac rhythms but points directly to technical issues with electrode placement or connectivity, compromising the reliability of any morphological or interval analysis beyond the brief initial segment.

Yes, this ECG shows electrode problems.
