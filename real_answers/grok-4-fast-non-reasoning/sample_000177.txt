The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which complicate precise morphological analysis, particularly in the context of a pacemaker's presence that may alter native rhythms and introduce pacing spikes. Nonetheless, examining the initial 0.12 seconds of data—before the prolonged flatline suggesting recording interruption or technical failure—the limb leads show a clear pattern: lead I displays an initial negative deflection (-1.35 mV), transitioning to positive values (up to +0.69 mV), while lead II and lead III exhibit predominantly positive deflections (peaking at +0.69 mV and +0.73 mV, respectively), with lead aVF also positive (up to +1.42 mV) and aVL showing mixed but ultimately positive morphology. This configuration indicates a frontal plane QRS axis shifted toward the positive pole of lead I and the positive pole of lead II/aVF, consistent with left axis deviation, likely between -30° and -90°, potentially influenced by the pacemaker's ventricular pacing mode, which often manifests as a leftward axis due to apical lead placement. Intervals are difficult to measure accurately amid noise and the short effective recording, but the observed patterns in the augmented and limb leads do not suggest right axis deviation or extreme shifts, despite the artifacts and extra beats that could mimic or obscure subtle abnormalities.

Final answer: Left axis deviation
