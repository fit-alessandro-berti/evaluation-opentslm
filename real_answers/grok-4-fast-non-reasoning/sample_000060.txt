The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in accurate interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which obscure precise measurement of intervals; additionally, the presence of a pacemaker suggests paced rhythms that can alter QRS morphology and duration, often leading to wider complexes. Examining the initial 0.1 seconds of data, the limb leads (I, II, III) show small baseline fluctuations transitioning to larger deflections around 0.02-0.06 seconds, indicative of possible P waves or artifacts followed by QRS-like activity, but the noise makes it difficult to delineate the exact onset of the Q wave, the peak of the R wave, and the end of the S wave. In precordial leads V1-V3, there are prominent positive deflections (e.g., up to 5.77 mV in V3 at 0.01 s), consistent with paced ventricular depolarization, where the QRS typically starts abruptly after the pacing spike (though spikes may be lost in the 100 Hz sampling or noise), and the complexes appear broad, spanning roughly 0.06-0.08 seconds based on the duration from initial deviation to return to baseline in leads like V1 and II, suggesting a prolonged conduction time. The overall patterns point to ventricular pacing, which commonly results in QRS durations exceeding the normal range of 80-120 ms due to dyssynchronous activation from the pacemaker site, often in the right ventricle, and the clinical context of extra beats further supports irregular widening; without cleaner signal processing, exact millisecond measurement is approximate, but the morphology and context strongly indicate abnormal prolongation rather than normal narrow complexes seen in sinus rhythm.

The QRS duration falls above the normal range.
