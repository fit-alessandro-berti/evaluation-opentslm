The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which complicate precise interpretation, particularly in a 70-year-old male with a pacemaker that may alter depolarization patterns and axis determination. The initial 0.12 seconds of data show irregular voltage fluctuations across leads, with lead I displaying small positive (0.13 mV) to negative (-1.71 mV) deflections, lead II mirroring lead I in this short segment but then shifting to larger positive values (up to 6.96 mV), and lead aVF exhibiting predominantly positive deflections (up to 1.73 mV) interspersed with negatives (-2.13 mV), suggesting possible inferior orientation of the mean QRS vector. However, the abrupt transition to zero values from 0.12 seconds onward indicates a recording artifact or data truncation, rendering the majority of the 10-second trace uninterpretable for full ECG morphology, intervals, or reliable axis calculation using standard methods like the quadrant approach or net QRS area in leads I and aVF. Given the limited usable data, the patterns hint at a potentially normal or leftward axis in the visible portion (lead I positive overall, aVF positive), but noise and pacemaker presence preclude definitive assessment of extreme axis deviation, defined as >+90° (right) or <-30° (left), as no clear isoelectric or negative QRS complexes in key limb leads can be consistently identified to confirm such abnormality.

No, this ECG does not show extreme axis deviation based on the available interpretable data.
