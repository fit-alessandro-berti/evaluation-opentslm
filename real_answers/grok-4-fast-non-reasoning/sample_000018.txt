The provided ECG time series data reveals a very limited recording duration of only the first 0.12 seconds with non-zero signal values across all 12 leads, followed by 9.88 seconds of flatline (zero values), which immediately suggests a technical failure or artifact-dominated recording rather than a standard 10-second clinical ECG, especially given the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, compounded by the presence of a pacemaker that could introduce pacing spikes or capture abnormalities. In this brief initial segment, the voltage traces in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF exhibit irregular, low-amplitude oscillations with rapid deflections (e.g., from -1.087 mV to +0.905 mV in lead I at 0.00-0.03 s) that do not form recognizable P-QRS-T complexes, intervals like PR or QT cannot be reliably measured due to the chaotic morphology, and any potential T-wave forms are obscured by noise and drift, rendering these limb leads non-diagnostic for T-wave abnormalities such as inversion, elevation, or flattening that might indicate ischemia, hypertrophy, or electrolyte issues in this 73-year-old patient. Precordial leads V1-V6 show somewhat smoother but still low-amplitude patterns (e.g., V1 ranging from -0.535 mV to +0.745 mV) with possible subtle repolarization changes post-0.06 s, though the brevity and artifacts prevent definitive assessment of T-wave symmetry or duration; however, the question focuses on leads displaying symptoms of non-diagnostic T abnormalities, which aligns with the limb leads' complete lack of interpretable T-wave morphology amid the noise. The pacemaker presence further complicates interpretation, as paced rhythms often alter T-wave contours, but without clear complexes, no lead-specific T abnormality can be diagnosed.

**Final Answer:** Leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF
