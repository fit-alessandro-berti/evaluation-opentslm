The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the extensive baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker, which can mimic or obscure true abnormalities, while the noted extra beats further complicate rhythm analysis; however, examining the initial non-zero segment from 0 to 0.12 seconds across the 12 leads shows irregular deflections in leads I, II, and III, with values fluctuating from negative amplitudes around -1.7 mV to positive peaks near +1.2 mV, suggesting possible premature ventricular contractions or paced beats rather than consistent ST segment elevation/depression or T-wave inversions that would indicate ischemic ST/T changes. Intervals appear difficult to measure accurately amid the noise, but there is no clear evidence of prolonged PR, QRS widening, or absent P waves that typically define conduction disturbances like AV block or bundle branch block; instead, the pacemaker likely addresses any underlying conduction issue, and the artifacts dominate, pointing away from overt ST/T morphology alterations in the visible signal. Overall, the patterns lean toward artifacts and pacemaker-related activity rather than primary ST/T changes or conduction abnormalities.

Final answer: conduction disturbance
