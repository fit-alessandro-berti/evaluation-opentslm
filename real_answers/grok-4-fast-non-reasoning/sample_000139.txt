The provided ECG time series data reveals a very limited recording duration with meaningful signal, spanning only the first 0.12 seconds before flattening to zero, which complicates a full analysis but allows for an initial examination of the aVF lead in the available segment. In aVF, the voltage starts at -0.97 mV at t=0 s, drops to -0.98 mV at t=0.01 s, rises sharply to -0.03 mV at t=0.02 s, peaks at 1.03 mV at t=0.03 s, then declines to -0.70 mV at t=0.04 s and -0.73 mV at t=0.05 s, followed by a gradual increase to -0.63 mV at t=0.06 s and further to -0.83 mV at t=0.07 s, before continuing a downward trend to -1.21 mV at t=0.08 s and stabilizing around -0.63 mV at t=0.09 s, with the remainder of the trace showing no variation due to the data cutoff. This pattern in aVF suggests an initial isoelectric baseline transitioning into a prominent positive deflection consistent with a normal QRS complex morphology, indicating upright ventricular depolarization in the inferior direction, but the short duration and noted artifacts like baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, extra beats, and pacemaker presence introduce potential distortions that could mimic or obscure form-related abnormalities such as ST-segment changes or T-wave inversions typically associated with ischemia or infarction; however, no clear evidence of pathological forms like significant ST depression, elevation, or inverted T-waves is discernible in this fragment, though the pacemaker implies possible paced rhythms that might alter expected morphologies. The abrupt end of the signal limits definitive interval measurements, but the rapid rise and fall point to a standard QRS duration without obvious prolongation. Overall, the observed patterns in aVF do not show overt form-related symptoms of acute cardiac pathology in this partial view, though clinical correlation and a complete ECG would be essential given the patient's age and artifacts.

Final answer: No form-related symptoms detected in lead aVF.
