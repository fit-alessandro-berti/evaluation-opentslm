The provided ECG time series data reveals significant abnormalities right from the outset, with the initial 0.12 seconds showing fluctuating voltages across all leads that suggest irregular cardiac electrical activity, including potential P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves with inconsistent amplitudes and timingsâ€”such as a negative deflection around 0.00-0.05 seconds in lead I and II possibly indicating a pathological Q wave or atrial activity, followed by a prominent positive spike at 0.02 seconds that could represent a ventricular depolarization but lacks the typical narrow QRS morphology of normal sinus rhythm, and subsequent negative deflections at 0.04 seconds hinting at repolarization issues or ST segment changes. The presence of a pacemaker, as noted in the clinical context, is evident in the artificial pacing spikes or altered rhythms, which disrupt the natural sinus mechanism, while extra beats detected further indicate arrhythmias like premature ventricular contractions. Baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts compromise signal quality, making precise interval measurements challenging, but the overall lack of consistent 60-100 bpm sinus rhythm, normal PR intervals (0.12-0.20 s), QRS durations (<0.12 s), and QT intervals, combined with the pacemaker's influence, points to an underlying conduction disorder or ischemic condition in this 72-year-old patient. These patterns collectively suggest a non-normal ECG, likely reflecting paced rhythm with artifacts and irregular beats rather than healthy cardiac function.

No, this is not a normal ECG.
