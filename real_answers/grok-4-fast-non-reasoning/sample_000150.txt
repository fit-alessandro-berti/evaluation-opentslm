The provided ECG time series data appears to be incomplete or corrupted, as it contains only a brief segment of signal from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds with non-zero values across the 12 leads, followed by approximately 9.9 seconds of flatline (all zeros), which does not represent a typical 10-second clinical ECG recording and suggests significant artifacts or recording errors consistent with the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats. In the initial segment, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show fluctuating voltages indicative of possible atrial or ventricular activity, with lead II displaying prominent positive deflections around 0.06-0.08 seconds that could represent P waves or QRS complexes, while the precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit relatively smaller amplitudes and polarity shifts, such as negative values in V1-V3 early on transitioning to positive in later beats, potentially hinting at septal involvement; however, the presence of a pacemaker complicates interpretation, as paced rhythms often show wide QRS complexes with discordant ST segments, and the limited data prevents clear identification of ST elevation or Q waves necessary for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the short duration and noise, but the patterns in V1-V3 suggest possible anteroseptal abnormalities like poor R-wave progression or subtle ST changes, whereas leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 show less pronounced deviations without evident lateral wall involvement. Given the exclusion of uncertain symptoms and the data's poor quality, no definitive diagnostic symptom of myocardial infarction is discernible in either the lateral or anteroseptal leads.

Final answer: neither
