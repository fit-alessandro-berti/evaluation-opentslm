Examining the ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the initial 0.12 seconds show varying voltage amplitudes across leads, with lead I and II displaying a consistent positive deflection around 0.59 mV at 0 seconds, followed by negative excursions to -1.08 mV and -0.73 mV, and smaller fluctuations in precordial leads like V1-V6, suggesting some early cardiac signal capture possibly influenced by the pacemaker and extra beats noted in the context. However, from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly flatline at 0.00 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds, indicating a complete absence of electrical activity or signal, which aligns more with equipment-related issues than physiological patterns. This prolonged flatline disrupts any interpretable ECG morphology, such as P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves, and prevents assessment of intervals like PR or QT, while the clinical note of electrode artifacts points to poor contact or disconnection as the likely culprit for this uniform loss of signal across all leads, rather than random, high-frequency static noise that would appear as erratic, broadband interference scattered throughout the recording. The early non-zero values may reflect brief valid capture before the issue, but the dominant pattern is a total signal dropout, characteristic of electrode problems rather than static noise, which typically overlays the cardiac signal without erasing it entirely.

**Final Answer:** electrode problems
