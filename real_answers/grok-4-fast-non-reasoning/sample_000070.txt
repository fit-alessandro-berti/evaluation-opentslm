The provided ECG time series data appears to be severely truncated or corrupted, with meaningful signal present only in the initial 0.12 seconds, followed by approximately 9.88 seconds of flatline (all zeros), rendering a full 10-second analysis impossible and preventing reliable assessment of cardiac rhythms, intervals, or morphologies such as QRS axis, ST segments, or fascicular conduction patterns. In the brief initial segment, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show small-amplitude deflections consistent with possible P waves and QRS complexes, but with significant baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats as noted in the clinical context, the patterns are obscured and do not clearly demonstrate ST-T abnormalities suggestive of ischemia in inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5, V6), which would typically appear as ST depression or elevation with reciprocal changes. Similarly, no consistent left axis deviation (QRS axis ≤ -45°) or qR morphology in lead aVL indicative of left anterior fascicular block is discernible amid the noise and pacemaker presence, which often alters native conduction patterns and complicates interpretation. The pacemaker spikes or paced rhythms are not evident in this short, noisy segment, and the overall poor signal quality precludes excluding uncertain symptoms or confirming either condition with confidence.

Neither ischemic changes in inferolateral leads nor left anterior fascicular block.
