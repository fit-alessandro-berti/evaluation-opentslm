The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in accurate analysis due to the presence of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, all compounded by a pacemaker, which can distort interval measurements like the QT intervalâ€”the time from the start of ventricular depolarization (QRS onset) to the end of repolarization (T-wave offset). The initial 0.12 seconds show some fluctuating voltages across leads, suggesting possible P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves in leads like II and V1, but the abrupt transition to zero values from 0.12 seconds onward indicates a recording artifact or truncation, rendering the full 10-second trace unusable for reliable morphology assessment. In a paced rhythm, QT measurement is often unreliable or not applicable as it reflects artificial stimulation rather than intrinsic conduction, and the noise further obscures clear identification of QRS and T-wave boundaries; for instance, early deflections in lead II around 0.02-0.05 seconds hint at a QRS duration but no consistent QT pattern emerges before the signal flatlines. Given the poor signal quality and limited viable data, estimating the QT interval is speculative, but based on the fragmented initial activity, it appears shortened or indeterminate, potentially in the subnormal range consistent with paced ventricular beats.

The QT interval falls in the range of 300-360 ms.
