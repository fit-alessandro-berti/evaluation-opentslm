The provided ECG time series data spans 10 seconds at 100 Hz sampling, but exhibits significant issues with signal quality, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of a pacemaker, which collectively obscure clear interpretation of cardiac rhythms. From 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show irregular deflections, such as a small negative P-like wave followed by a positive QRS complex in lead II around 0.02-0.03 seconds, transitioning to deeper negative T waves by 0.04-0.05 seconds, suggesting possible atrial activity and ventricular depolarization, but the morphology is distorted by noise and drifts (e.g., voltages shifting from -1.28 mV to +1.03 mV abruptly), making it difficult to measure precise intervals like PR or QT. The clinical note of extra beats detected during recording raises suspicion for premature complexes, and in leads like V1, there are narrow biphasic spikes around 0.06 seconds that could represent paced atrial events or supraventricular extrasystoles originating above the ventricles, given the young patient's age and absence of wide QRS indicating ventricular origin; however, the pacemaker likely contributes artificial pacing artifacts, and the flatline from 0.12 to 9.99 seconds provides no further data for rhythm analysis, preventing confirmation of repetitive or isolated supraventricular extrasystoles (e.g., PACs with normal QRS and short PR). Abnormalities such as inconsistent R-R intervals in the initial segment and noise-induced pseudo-waves further complicate distinguishing true supraventricular extrasystoles from artifacts or paced beats, though the overall pattern hints at atrial-level ectopy rather than sinus rhythm alone.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows features suggestive of supraventricular extrasystoles, though interpretation is limited by poor signal quality and pacemaker presence.
