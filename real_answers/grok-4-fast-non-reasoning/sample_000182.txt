The provided ECG time series data reveals a brief capture of cardiac electrical activity in the initial 0.11 seconds across multiple leads, exhibiting characteristic P-QRS-T waveforms with positive deflections in leads II, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 suggesting normal sinus rhythm morphology, though the short duration limits precise measurement of intervals like PR (appearing around 0.08-0.12 s) or QT; however, the abrupt negative spike in lead II at approximately 0.11 seconds indicates a premature ventricular contraction or extra beat, consistent with the clinical note of extra beats detected, followed immediately by flatline zero values from 0.12 seconds onward across all leads, which deviates from expected ongoing rhythmic activity in a 10-second recording and aligns with the reported signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker that may have inhibited further native or paced signals due to artifact or device malfunction. This absence of signal post-0.11 seconds, combined with the pacemaker context, suggests potential abnormal conduction suppression or recording failure rather than normal physiology, warranting re-evaluation for pacemaker capture or arrhythmia.

Yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms, including evidence of extra beats and severe signal artifact leading to loss of readable rhythm.
