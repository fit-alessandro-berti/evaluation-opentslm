The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of a pacemaker, which can distort waveforms and introduce extra beats, while the majority of the 10-second recording from 0.12 to 9.99 seconds consists of zero-valued signals across all leads, suggesting a recording artifact or pause rather than useful cardiac activity. In the initial 0.12 seconds of data, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show small-amplitude deflections that approximate a single QRS complex with subsequent repolarization phases, but the noise and drift obscure clear morphology; for instance, lead II exhibits a negative deflection at 0.00 s (-0.40359 mV) followed by positive peaks at 0.01 s (0.38736 mV) and 0.02 s (1.04858 mV), then a deeper negative at 0.04 s (-1.04757 mV) that returns toward baseline by 0.08 s (-0.42081 mV) and 0.09 s (0.09084 mV), potentially indicating a T-wave component that is either flat or subtly negative relative to the noisy baseline, though not definitively inverted. Similarly, in V4-V6, values dip to -0.97903 mV and -1.27274 mV at 0.04 s before recovering to positive levels like 0.83736 mV and 1.03985 mV at 0.01 s and 0.02 s, hinting at possible ST segment shifts below baseline amid artifacts, but without consistent horizontal depression or the characteristic scooped shape of non-specific ST depression across multiple beats or leads. The pacemaker presence likely contributes to these irregular patterns, possibly suppressing native conduction and masking repolarization abnormalities, while the extra beats mentioned in the context are not clearly discernible in this short, noisy segment. Overall, the limited viable data and artifacts prevent reliable identification of classic inverted T-waves (which would show symmetric, deep negative deflections post-QRS in contiguous leads) or non-specific ST depression (subtle, horizontal or downsloping ST shifts <1 mm without T-wave inversion), suggesting neither feature is convincingly demonstrated.

Final answer: neither (inadequate interpretable signal due to artifacts and noise).
