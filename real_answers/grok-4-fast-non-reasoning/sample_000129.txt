Examining the provided ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal fluctuating voltage values across all leads, such as lead I starting at -0.96849 mV and quickly rising to 1.37533 mV before dropping sharply to -3.16051 mV, with similar erratic patterns in II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and precordial leads V1 through V6, including abrupt transitions like V4 reaching 6.03667 mV at 0.08 seconds and V6 swinging to -3.82102 mV at the start; these wide-ranging, non-physiological deflections suggest irregular signal capture rather than consistent cardiac depolarization patterns. From 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly and uniformly drop to 0.00000 mV and remain there for the remaining 9.88 seconds, indicating a complete cessation of signal acquisition or recording. This prolonged flatline is inconsistent with normal ECG morphology, which should display repeating P-QRS-T complexes every 0.6-1.0 seconds in a paced rhythm, and instead points to technical failure in lead connections or electrode placement, preventing any ongoing detection of cardiac electrical activity; the clinical context explicitly notes electrode artifacts, supporting this interpretation over baseline drift, static/burst noise, or extra beats, as the issue manifests as total signal loss rather than intermittent noise or drift superimposed on interpretable waveforms.

Yes, this ECG shows electrode problems.
