The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and the presence of extra beats, which obscure clear visualization of cardiac waveforms across the 12 leads over the 10-second recording at 100 Hz. The initial 0.12 seconds show some variability in amplitudes, with lead II displaying notably high positive deflections (e.g., up to 7.074 mV at 0.10 s) suggestive of possible tall R waves or noise-induced spikes, while leads like III and aVF exhibit large negative excursions (e.g., -6.613 mV at 0.03 s), and precordial leads (V1-V6) remain relatively low-amplitude and flat, potentially indicating right ventricular involvement or artifacts rather than true ischemic changes; however, from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads flatline to 0 mV, representing no meaningful cardiac signal and rendering the latter portion uninterpretable. In a young 26-year-old female with a pacemaker, such patterns do not align with classic middle-stage myocardial infarction features, which typically evolve from hyperacute T waves to ST-segment elevation (â‰¥1-2 mm in contiguous leads) and Q-wave development in the subacute phase (hours to days post-onset), often with reciprocal changes, but here the noise and artifacts mimic or mask any potential ST shifts, and the flatline suggests technical failure rather than evolving infarction morphology. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the poor quality and absence of identifiable P, QRS, or T components, and the pacemaker presence may further complicate native rhythm assessment without pacing spikes visible in the noisy initial segment. Overall, while myocardial infarction cannot be entirely excluded without cleaner data or clinical correlation (e.g., symptoms, troponins), the observed irregularities point more to recording artifacts than definitive middle-stage infarction criteria.

No, this ECG does not show middle stage of myocardial infarction.
