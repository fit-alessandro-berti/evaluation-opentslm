The provided ECG time series data is incomplete, containing only a brief initial segment (approximately 0.12 seconds) with non-zero voltage values across the 12 leads, followed by over 9 seconds of flatline (all zeros), which prevents a full analysis of the cardiac axis or any meaningful interpretation of heart rhythm, intervals, or morphology. In the available portion, lead I shows an initial negative deflection (-0.319 mV at 0s) transitioning to positive peaks (up to 0.828 mV at 0.02s), while lead aVF exhibits a small initial negative value (-0.407 mV) but quickly becomes positive (up to 0.900 mV at 0.05s), suggesting a predominantly positive QRS complex in both inferior and lateral directions despite the presence of artifacts like baseline drift and noise as noted in the clinical context; however, the pacemaker spikes (not clearly discernible in this short, noisy segment) and extra beats further complicate assessment, and the extreme brevity of the data makes it impossible to reliably determine the mean QRS axis, as standard evaluation requires examining multiple consecutive QRS complexes for net positivity or negativity in leads I and aVF. Without additional data or a complete tracing, the cardiac axis cannot be accurately classified.
