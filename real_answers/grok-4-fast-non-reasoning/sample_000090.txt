The provided ECG time series data reveals a limited recording period with only the first 0.11 seconds containing non-zero signal values across the leads, followed by extensive flatline artifacts from 0.12 seconds onward, likely due to the noted electrode artifacts, baseline drift, static and burst noise, and pacemaker presence, which compromise the overall interpretability of the trace. In the initial segment, the V4 lead shows voltage fluctuations starting at -0.71 mV, rising to -1.37 mV, briefly positive at -0.25 mV, peaking at 1.12 mV, dipping to -0.27 mV and -0.94 mV, then reaching 1.40 mV and ending at 1.44 mV, suggesting possible QRS complexes and T-wave deflections amid the noise and extra beats, but the morphology is too fragmented and noisy to clearly delineate a complete T-wave for polarity assessment. The presence of a pacemaker may introduce pacing spikes or altered repolarization patterns, while the poor signal quality obscures standard interval measurements like QT or precise ST segments, making it challenging to identify repolarization abnormalities such as T-wave inversion, which typically appears as a negative deflection following the QRS in precordial leads like V4, potentially indicating ischemia or strain in a 66-year-old female. Given the incomplete and artifact-ridden data, no definitive T-wave morphology can be confirmed in V4.

No, this ECG does not show clear symptoms of inverted T-waves in lead V4 due to insufficient interpretable signal.
