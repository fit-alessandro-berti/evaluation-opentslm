Examining the ECG time series data for lead V1, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal clear cardiac waveform patterns with deflections ranging from -3.44 mV to 3.85 mV, indicative of QRS complexes and T waves consistent with a paced rhythm given the clinical context of a pacemaker, but from 0.12 seconds onward, the signal abruptly flattens to exactly 0.00 mV across the entire 10-second recording, which is highly unnatural for a physiological ECG and suggests a recording artifact or data truncation rather than true baseline activity. This prolonged zero level disrupts the expected morphology, eliminating identifiable P waves, QRS intervals, or ST segments, and aligns with the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, potentially exacerbated by the pacemaker's electrical interference or extra beats detected. The absence of any variability or noise-like fluctuations in the later portion implies a complete loss of signal integrity specific to V1, while other leads show similar initial activity before zeroing out, pointing to a systemic recording problem but prominently affecting V1's usability for diagnostic interpretation. Yes, this ECG shows noise in lead V1, primarily in the form of baseline artifacts leading to signal dropout.
