The provided ECG time series data exhibits significant artifacts, including a prolonged segment of zero values across all leads from approximately 0.12 to 9.99 seconds, which suggests a recording interruption or equipment failure rather than physiological signals, but true cardiac activity is only captured in the initial 0.12 seconds where non-zero deflections are present. In this brief active portion, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show relatively smooth, correlated voltage changes consistent with expected ECG morphology, such as biphasic or triphasic patterns indicative of atrial and ventricular depolarization, though the short duration limits full interval assessment like PR or QT; however, the precordial leads (V1 through V6) display abrupt, high-amplitude spikes and erratic fluctuations—for instance, V1 jumps from -3.49 mV to 3.11 mV and back to -3.68 mV within 0.04 seconds, V2 from -2.28 mV to 2.34 mV, and similar irregular bursts in V3-V6—that do not align with typical R-wave progression or repolarization patterns and instead represent superimposed static noise, likely from poor electrode contact on the chest as noted in the clinical context, while the limb leads remain comparatively clean. This noise in precordial leads could obscure pacemaker spikes or extra beats but does not appear to affect the overall rhythm interpretation in the limited data available.

**Final Answer:** V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6
