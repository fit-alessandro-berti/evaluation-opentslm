The provided ECG time series data reveals a brief recording of approximately 0.12 seconds with visible cardiac activity before flattening to zero, likely due to signal interruption or recording artifact, compounded by the noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and presence of a pacemaker, which can introduce pacing spikes and alter normal waveforms. Examining the limb leads, lead I shows a positive deflection starting at 1.91 mV and rising to 2.71 mV, lead II mirrors this positive pattern with similar amplitudes, lead III displays a more pronounced positive rise to 2.80 mV, while aVR is predominantly positive but less dynamic, aVL positive but lower amplitude, and aVF strongly positive, indicating upright P-QRS-T complexes in the inferior and lateral leads without significant axis shift. The precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit smaller amplitudes with some negative components in V1, transitioning to positive in lateral leads, consistent with normal septal-to-lateral progression, though noise and extra beats obscure finer details like intervals or ST segments. The pacemaker presence suggests possible paced rhythm, but the initial patterns lack overt signs of hypertrophy or infarction affecting axis. Overall, these morphologies point to a normal cardiac electrical axis without deviation.

**Final Answer:** Normal axis
