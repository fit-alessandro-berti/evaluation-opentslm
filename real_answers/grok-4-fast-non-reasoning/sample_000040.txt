Examining the provided ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, the signal in lead V3 reveals a clear pattern of low-frequency wandering in the baseline, particularly evident in the initial segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds where values fluctuate gradually from -0.21804 mV to 1.41906 mV and then drop sharply to -2.04309 mV by 0.07 seconds, before stabilizing somewhat around -0.38831 mV at 0.09 seconds and holding at 0.00000 mV from 0.12 seconds onward; this slow, undulating deviation from a flat line, rather than remaining steady or showing only high-frequency noise or cardiac deflections, aligns with baseline drift, which can obscure true ECG morphology such as P waves, QRS complexes, or ST segments, especially in the context of the noted overall signal quality issues including baseline drift across leads, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, while the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats may contribute to some irregularities but do not account for the non-cardiac low-amplitude oscillations specific to V3 in this early portion. Yes, this ECG shows baseline drift in lead V3.
