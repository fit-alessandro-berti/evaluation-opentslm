Examining the provided ECG time series data reveals a very limited recording, with only the first 0.12 seconds containing non-zero signal values across the 12 leads, followed by approximately 9.88 seconds of flatline (zero values), likely due to recording artifacts or equipment issues noted in the clinical context such as baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats; this flatline segment prevents any meaningful assessment of rhythm, intervals, or morphology beyond the initial portion. In the initial 0.12 seconds, the limb leads show positive deflections in I (peaking at 4.26 mV), II (4.74 mV), and aVF (2.42 mV), alongside negative values in aVR (-1.31 to 2.46 mV range) and aVL (-1.73 to 1.86 mV), while the precordial leads V1-V6 display positive spikes up to 3.1 mV, consistent with paced QRS complexes from the patient's pacemaker, suggesting ventricular pacing with a focus on the right ventricle; the positive patterns in leads I, II, and aVF indicate an inferior-to-superior vector for the paced impulse, with the overall morphology showing dominant inferior lead positivity and left-sided lead negativity, pointing to a leftward and inferior axis deviation rather than rightward or superior. The presence of extra beats and noise further complicates interpretation, but the key axis determination relies on the net QRS direction in the frontal plane from these early complexes. The ECG axis is deviated to the left inferior quadrant.

**Final Answer:** Left inferior
