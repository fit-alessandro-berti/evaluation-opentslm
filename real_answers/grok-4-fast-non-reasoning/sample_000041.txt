The provided ECG time series data appears to be severely truncated, with only the first 0.12 seconds containing non-zero values across the leads, followed by 9.88 seconds of flatline (zero amplitude) recordings, which is atypical for a standard 10-second 12-lead ECG and likely reflects a recording artifact or data transmission error rather than a true cardiac signal. In the initial segment, the voltages in leads I, II, and III show positive deflections up to approximately 4.57 mV and negative deflections down to -4.76 mV, suggesting possible P-QRS-T complexes or pacemaker spikes consistent with the noted pacemaker presence and extra beats, while augmented leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) exhibit mixed polarities and precordial leads (V1-V6) display smaller amplitudes around Â±0.8 mV, all amid significant noise from baseline drift, static, burst, and electrode artifacts that obscure clear morphology. Non-specific ST depression typically manifests as a horizontal or downsloping segment 0.5-1 mm below the PR baseline in multiple leads, often in inferior (II, III, aVF) or lateral (I, aVL, V4-V6) territories, indicating potential subendocardial ischemia in an 84-year-old patient, but the limited data prevents definitive identification of J-point deviation or isoelectric line for accurate measurement of intervals like PR, QRS, or QT. The noise and flatline further complicate assessment, suggesting the need for a complete, high-quality ECG to evaluate for abnormalities, though the early patterns do not clearly demonstrate ST depression in any specific leads based on the available information.

No leads are showing symptoms of non-specific ST depression in this ECG due to the incomplete and artifact-laden data.
