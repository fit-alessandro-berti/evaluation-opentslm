The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the extensive baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker presence, which collectively obscure clear delineation of cardiac waveforms across the 12 leads over the 10-second recording; however, focusing on the initial 0.12 seconds where non-zero values are present, irregular deflections are evident, such as the abrupt positive spike in lead II at 0.02 seconds (0.41804 mV) followed by a negative excursion at 0.04 seconds (-0.25779 mV), and similar aberrant patterns in precordial leads like V1 and V6 showing deep inversions and tall R waves that deviate from typical sinus morphology. These early irregularities, coupled with the clinical note of detected extra beats, suggest premature ventricular contractions characterized by wide, bizarre QRS complexes without preceding P waves, altered morphology compared to presumed baseline rhythms, and compensatory pauses implied by the sparse data points, though the pacemaker could indicate paced ventricular rhythms mimicking or masking true extrasystoles. Intervals are difficult to precisely measure amid the noise, but the abnormal voltage amplitudes and lack of consistent isoelectric lines point toward ventricular origin for these ectopic beats rather than supraventricular sources. Overall, the patterns align with ventricular extrasystoles despite diagnostic limitations from artifacts.

Yes, this ECG shows ventricular extrasystoles.
