The ECG time series reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a notable absence of meaningful cardiac deflections after the initial 0.12 seconds, where all leads drop to zero voltage for the remaining 9.88 seconds of the 10-second recording, suggesting either a recording failure or disconnection rather than ongoing cardiac activity. In the brief initial segment (0-0.12 seconds), there are irregular voltage fluctuations across leads, such as negative deflections around -0.8 to -1.0 mV in leads I, II, and others at 0.01-0.02 seconds, followed by positive spikes up to 1.33 mV in lead II at 0.06 seconds, and a consistent positive plateau of 0.54 mV at 0.10 seconds, which could represent fragmented P-QRS-T complexes or pacemaker spikes given the clinical note of a pacemaker and extra beats, but the irregularity and noise obscure clear rhythm identification. Intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the poor quality and truncated data, but the presence of extra beats noted in the context implies potential arrhythmias like premature ventricular contractions or atrial ectopics, while the pacemaker suggests underlying conduction disease such as bradycardia or heart block that might manifest as paced rhythm symptoms. Overall, the patterns point to disrupted electrical activity consistent with rhythm abnormalities exacerbated by artifacts, though the flatline limits definitive assessment of sustained rhythm issues like tachycardia, fibrillation, or asystole.

Final answer: Yes, this ECG shows rhythm-related symptoms, including evidence of extra beats and likely pacemaker influence amid poor signal quality.
