The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the presence of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and a pacemaker, which collectively obscure clear PQRST morphology and intervals across the 12 leads; however, the initial 0.12 seconds of recording shows discernible patterns that allow for axis determination, a key aspect of ECG deviation referring to the mean QRS axis in the frontal plane. Examining the limb leads, lead I displays an initial negative deflection (-0.14491 mV at 0s, -0.19526 mV at 0.01s, rising to positive 1.16048 mV at 0.11s), suggesting a positive overall QRS component, while lead aVF shows predominantly negative values (-0.25607 mV at 0s, -0.33237 mV at 0.04s, -1.17413 mV at 0.09s, though with some positive excursions like 0.43319 mV at 0.06s), indicating a net negative QRS; lead II and III exhibit mixed but leaning negative trends early on (-0.14491 mV and -0.10786 mV at 0s, dropping to -1.19421 mV and -1.18417 mV at 0.09s). These patterns, despite noise, point to a leftward and superior orientation of the QRS vector, as positive in I combined with negative in aVF typically reflects left axis deviation (LAD), potentially exacerbated by the patient's age and pacemaker influence, which can alter conduction and axis; the subsequent flatline from 0.12s onward likely represents recording artifact rather than true asystole, limiting further analysis but not invalidating the initial axis assessment. Overall, the observed morphology and net polarities suggest a cardiac electrical axis deviated to the left.

Final answer: Left axis deviation
