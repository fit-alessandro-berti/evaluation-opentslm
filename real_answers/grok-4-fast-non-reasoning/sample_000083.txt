The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which obscure clear interpretation, but the initial 0.11 seconds of recording show discernible patterns indicative of cardiac activity in a 59-year-old female with a noted pacemaker. Examining the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF), there are deflections suggesting P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves, though distorted; for instance, positive deflections in II and aVF around 0.05-0.08 seconds likely represent QRS activity, while negative excursions in aVR and aVL are consistent with normal axis deviation, but the irregular amplitudes and sudden shifts (e.g., from 1.297 mV in II at 0.07 seconds to -0.460 mV at 0.11 seconds) point to premature ventricular contractions or extra beats as detected during recording. Precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit high amplitudes early on (e.g., up to 1.149 mV in V1 at 0.01 seconds), transitioning to negative values, which could reflect ventricular depolarization patterns altered by the pacemaker, potentially indicating paced rhythms with possible failure to capture or sensing issues given the noise. Intervals are difficult to precisely measure due to artifacts, but the abrupt change at 0.11 seconds and subsequent flatline from 0.12 to 10 seconds suggest either recording cessation, profound bradycardia, asystole, or technical failure rather than ongoing sinus rhythm. Overall, the morphology hints at underlying conduction abnormalities consistent with pacemaker dependence, and the extra beats represent an irregularity, though the poor signal quality limits definitive assessment of intervals like PR or QT.

Yes, this ECG shows abnormal symptoms, including extra beats, possible paced rhythm irregularities, and severe signal artifacts suggestive of technical or clinical concerns like asystole post-initial activity.
