The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, exhibits significant signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted presence of a pacemaker, which collectively obscure clear interpretation of cardiac rhythms; however, examining the initial portion where non-zero values are recorded reveals irregular deflections in multiple leads, such as sharp positive spikes around 0.06 seconds in leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1-V6 suggesting possible paced QRS complexes, followed by a negative deflection at 0.11 seconds that could represent a T wave or repolarization phase, and earlier small amplitude variations at 0.00-0.05 seconds that might indicate premature atrial or ventricular activity before the primary beat. The subsequent flatline from 0.12 to 10.00 seconds likely reflects recording artifacts or equipment failure rather than true asystole, but the clinical note of extra beats detected during recording aligns with the irregular early patterns, where RR intervals appear shortened or aberrant compared to typical sinus rhythm, potentially indicating premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or premature atrial contractions (PACs) superimposed on paced rhythm, though noise and pacemaker spikes complicate definitive morphology assessment of P waves, QRS duration, or ST segments. In a 78-year-old patient with a pacemaker, such irregularities could suggest ventricular extra systoles, especially given the context of detected extra beats, warranting correlation with clinical symptoms and possibly a repeat ECG for confirmation.

Yes, this ECG shows extra systoles, likely premature ventricular contractions in the context of paced rhythm.
