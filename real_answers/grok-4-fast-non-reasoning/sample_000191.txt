Examining the ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds for this 78-year-old female patient with a noted pacemaker and various artifacts, the initial 0.12 seconds reveal varying voltage amplitudes across leads consistent with cardiac waveforms like P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves, though the presence of a pacemaker may influence morphology, and extra beats could explain irregular patterns; however, from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly drop to exactly 0.00000 mV for the remaining duration, indicating a loss of signal rather than physiological activity, which aligns with recording issues rather than a cardiac condition like asystole, given the clinical context of poor signal quality including baseline drift, burst noise, and electrode artifacts. This flatline pattern suggests a technical failure in data acquisition or transmission after the initial segment, potentially masking true ECG morphology, intervals such as PR or QT, or pacemaker spikes, but focusing on static noise—characterized by persistent, non-physiological high-frequency fluctuations superimposed on the baseline—the first 0.12 seconds show no such consistent random static across all leads, as values fluctuate in a manner more indicative of cardiac signals or transient artifacts like burst noise or electrode contact issues, rather than uniform static interference.

**Final Answer:** None of the leads show static noise in this ECG data.
