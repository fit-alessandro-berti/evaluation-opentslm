The ECG data for lead V1 reveals significant signal quality issues, as the values fluctuate dramatically and abruptly in the initial 0.11 secondsâ€”starting at 0.135 mV, dropping sharply to -0.563 mV at 0.01 s, plunging further to -1.043 mV at 0.02 s, then spiking to 0.328 mV at 0.03 s and peaking at 1.165 mV at 0.04 s, before stabilizing somewhat around 0.682 mV at 0.06 s and gradually trending toward zero. These extreme, non-physiological swings, exceeding typical QRS amplitudes (usually <2.5 mV) and lacking consistent cardiac waveform morphology like P-QRS-T patterns, suggest artifactual interference rather than true cardiac activity; specifically, the sudden bursts of high-amplitude deviations resemble burst noise from transient electrical interference or equipment glitches, while the overall irregular baseline shifts indicate baseline drift possibly due to patient movement or poor electrode contact. Electrode artifacts are also evident in the erratic nature of these changes, potentially exacerbated by the noted pacemaker and extra beats, which could introduce additional spikes, though the static noise mentioned in the context appears less dominant here as there's no pervasive low-level fuzziness but rather punctuated disruptions. From 0.12 s onward, the signal flattens to zero, likely indicating a recording pause or data truncation, further compromising interpretability but highlighting the initial segment's noisy character without clear relation to intervals or abnormalities like arrhythmias beyond the artifacts themselves.

**Final Answer:** Burst noise, baseline drift, and electrode artifacts.
