The provided ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds for a 17-year-old female with noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and a pacemaker, shows only the initial 0.12 seconds with non-zero voltage values across the 12 leads, followed by nearly 10 seconds of flat zero lines, which is not a typical clinical ECG recording and suggests a data acquisition or transmission error rather than a true cardiac signal; in this short initial segment, the voltage amplitudes fluctuate between approximately -1.74 mV and +2.11 mV, which are within normal ranges for ECG deflections (typically up to 2-3 mV in limb and precordial leads), and the rapid changes over 0.12 seconds imply a heart rate exceeding 500 bpm if interpreted as QRS complexes, far outside normal (60-100 bpm), but with the extensive flatline, no reliable RR intervals, PR/QRS/QT durations, or axis can be measured, though the absence of excessive ST elevation/depression or abnormal T-wave inversions in the visible portion aligns with normal morphology where discernible. Given the pacemaker presence and artifacts, the flatline may represent pacing inhibition or noise suppression, but overall, the only numeric features confidently within normal ranges are the voltage amplitudes in the initial segment and potentially a normal sinus-like origin if ignoring the flatline anomaly.

The numeric features of this ECG that fall within the normal range are voltage amplitudes (typically 0.5-2.5 mV for major deflections).
