The provided ECG time series data reveals significant artifacts and noise, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a long stretch of flatline readings from approximately 0.12 seconds to 9.99 seconds across all leads, which severely limits reliable interpretation of the full 10-second recording; however, the initial segment (0.00 to 0.11 seconds) shows discernible cardiac activity with prominent positive deflections in leads I, II, and the precordial leads (V1-V6), suggestive of ventricular depolarization, alongside smaller initial waves that may represent atrial activity or pacemaker spikes, consistent with the clinical note of a present pacemaker and detected extra beats. The morphology in this brief window demonstrates regular, paced QRS complexes without evidence of narrow-complex tachycardia or rapid rates exceeding 100 bpm that would indicate supraventricular tachycardia, as the visible intervals appear appropriately spaced for a paced rhythm rather than an endogenous tachyarrhythmia, and the absence of P waves or irregular atrial activity further supports artificial pacing over a supraventricular origin. Given the pacemaker presence and the lack of tachycardic patterns amidst the poor signal quality, the observed features align more closely with expected pacemaker-driven ventricular capture than with supraventricular tachycardia.

Final answer: normal functioning artificial pacemaker
