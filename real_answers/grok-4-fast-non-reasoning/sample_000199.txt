The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in accurate interpretation due to the noted signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, which obscure clear delineation of waveform components, particularly in the presence of a pacemaker that likely influences ventricular depolarization and repolarization patterns. The initial 0.12 seconds show some fluctuating voltages across leads, suggestive of possible QRS complexes or paced beats in leads like II and V1 (e.g., positive deflections around 0.01-0.02 s and negative spikes at 0.06 s), but the absence of identifiable P waves, consistent T waves, or reliable RR intervals prevents precise measurement of the QT interval, which requires identifying the onset of the QRS to the end of the T wave in a stable sinus or paced rhythm. From 0.12 s onward, the data flattens to zero across all leads, indicating either a recording artifact, equipment failure, or absence of ongoing cardiac signal capture for the majority of the 10-second duration, rendering it impossible to observe multiple cardiac cycles or calculate heart rate-adjusted QTc values using formulas like Bazett's. Normal QT intervals typically range from 350-440 ms in men, varying with heart rate, but without measurable complexes or a stable baseline, no valid assessment of QT prolongation, shortening, or normality can be made, as artifacts and pacemaker spikes further complicate morphology analysis for conditions like long QT syndrome or repolarization abnormalities.

No, the QT interval cannot be determined to fall within the normal range due to insufficient interpretable signal data.
