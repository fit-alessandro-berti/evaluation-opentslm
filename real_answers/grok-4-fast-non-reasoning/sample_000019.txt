Examining the ECG time series for lead V2, the initial 0.12 seconds show a fluctuating signal with values ranging from approximately 2.19 mV down to -1.61 mV and back up to 0.19 mV, indicative of cardiac complexes interspersed with some variability, but from 0.12 seconds onward, the signal abruptly flattens to a constant 0.00 mV for the remaining 9.88 seconds of the recording, which deviates markedly from the expected dynamic morphology of a paced or unpaced ECG in a 73-year-old female with detected extra beats and a pacemaker. This persistent zero level aligns with the clinical note of poor signal quality, suggesting an absence of meaningful cardiac waveform capture after the initial segment, likely due to a disruption in signal acquisition rather than a physiological event like asystole, given the presence of pacemaker activity noted overall. The pattern implies technical interference preventing detection of intervals, QRS morphology, or abnormalities such as ST changes or arrhythmias in V2 beyond the start, rendering the lead uninterpretable for diagnostic purposes in assessing cardiac condition.

The ECG in lead V2 shows flatline noise due to loss of signal.
