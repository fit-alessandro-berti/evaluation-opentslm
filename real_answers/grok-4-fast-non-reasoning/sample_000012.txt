The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and detected extra beats, which complicate precise interval measurements; additionally, the presence of a pacemaker suggests potential paced rhythms that could alter QRS morphology and duration. Examining the initial non-zero segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds, the limb leads (I, II, III) and precordial leads (V1-V6) show a P wave-like deflection around 0.00-0.03 seconds, followed by a QRS complex starting with a negative deflection in V1 and II at approximately 0.03 seconds, transitioning to positive peaks in II and V5-V6 by 0.04 seconds, and ending with T wave repolarization by 0.08-0.09 seconds, spanning roughly 0.05 seconds or 50 ms for the main QRS in lead II. However, the noisy baseline and abrupt zeroing after 0.12 seconds prevent identification of subsequent beats for averaging, and pacemaker artifacts may indicate ventricular pacing, where QRS durations are typically prolonged to 120-200 ms due to artificial ventricular activation, exceeding the normal range of 80-120 ms for intrinsic conduction. These patterns suggest possible bundle branch block or paced rhythm contributing to widened QRS, though artifacts obscure definitive morphology like slurred S waves or notching.

**Final Answer:** Yes, the QRS duration likely falls above the normal range, potentially due to pacing or conduction delay, but poor signal quality limits certainty.
