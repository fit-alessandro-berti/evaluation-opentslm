The provided ECG time series data reveals significant challenges in interpretation due to the presence of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker, all of which can mimic or obscure arrhythmic patterns, but focusing on the initial 0.12 seconds of meaningful signal before the extensive flatline (likely an artifact or recording issue), there are abrupt voltage deflections in leads I, II, and others—such as a sharp positive spike in lead II from -0.81 mV at 0.00 s to 2.26 mV at 0.01 s, followed by a rapid decline and subsequent oscillations—that suggest irregular early complexes potentially representing extra beats. These patterns show shortened intervals between deflections compared to typical sinus rhythm, with morphologies in limb leads resembling premature atrial contractions, where P waves might be implied by the early onset but distorted by noise, and QRS-like features appearing narrow in V leads without clear ventricular widening, consistent with supraventricular origin rather than ventricular ectopy. The clinical note of extra beats detected during recording further supports this, as the pacemaker may not suppress all atrial-level irregularities, and the absence of prolonged QT or wide complexes argues against other abnormalities; however, the poor signal quality limits definitive morphology assessment, making it plausible but not conclusive that these represent supraventricular extrasystoles originating above the ventricles.

Yes, this ECG shows supraventricular extrasystoles.
