Examining the ECG time series data for lead V1 at 100 Hz sampling over 10 seconds reveals significant signal quality issues consistent with the clinical notes, including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts, alongside the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats in the initial segment. The first 0.12 seconds show fluctuating amplitudes, such as sharp drops to -4.31338 mV at 0.03 s and rises to 4.49887 mV at 0.00 s, interspersed with more stable periods like the spike to 4.99570 mV at 0.09 s, suggesting irregular disruptions that could stem from muscle activity or loose connections typical of static noise, which manifests as low-level, persistent, random fluctuations across the trace. However, from 0.12 s onward, the signal flattens completely to 0.00000 mV for the remaining ~9.88 seconds, indicating a prolonged, uniform dropout rather than scattered interference; this pattern aligns with burst noise, characterized by sudden, high-amplitude, short-duration spikes or, in this case, an extended loss of signal integrity, possibly due to intermittent equipment malfunction, electrode detachment, or pacemaker-related interference causing a recording halt. The morphology lacks discernible QRS complexes, P waves, or T waves in V1 beyond the initial irregular beats, with intervals unmeasurable due to the flatline, pointing to artifact dominance over cardiac signals, and the pacemaker likely contributes to the early extra beats but not the later silence. Overall, while static noise appears in the opening fluctuations, the dominant and extended flatline in V1 points to burst noise as the primary issue.

**Final Answer:** burst noise
