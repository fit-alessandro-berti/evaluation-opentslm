The provided ECG time series data reveals significant signal quality issues, including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a noted pacemaker presence, which complicate precise interpretation, but the initial 0.12 seconds of non-zero values show irregular deflections suggesting premature beats amid the noise. Examining the morphology in leads like V1 and V2, there are abrupt, wide, and discordant QRS-like complexes that deviate from any expected paced rhythm, with short coupling intervals and no preceding P waves visible in the limb leads, pointing to ectopic ventricular origin rather than supraventricular. Intervals appear prolonged in the extrasystolic beats, consistent with ventricular conduction delay, and the post-extrasystolic pause is compensatory, further supporting ventricular rather than atrial extrasystoles. The question's phrasing appears to contain a redundancy, likely intending to distinguish between ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles, but the patterns observed align solely with ventricular extrasystoles.

**Final Answer:** Ventricular extrasystoles
