Examining the ECG time series data for lead V4 at a 100 Hz sampling rate over 10 seconds, the initial segment from 0.00 to 0.11 seconds reveals clear cardiac waveform morphology with varying amplitudes, such as a negative deflection at 0.00 (-0.53730 mV), a positive peak at 0.02 (2.46000 mV), and subsequent fluctuations indicative of P-QRS-T complexes, suggesting normal electrical activity despite the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats noted in the clinical context. From 0.12 seconds onward through the entire remaining duration to 9.99 seconds, the V4 values remain consistently at 0.00000 mV, representing a flat baseline without any discernible cardiac deflections, intervals, or abnormalities like ectopic beats, which aligns with the reported baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts across the recording. This prolonged flatline in V4, while other leads (e.g., I, II, V1 in the early segment) show activity before also flattening, points to a recording or electrode issue rather than physiological cardiac patterns, as true asystole or pacemaker failure would typically affect all leads uniformly and be accompanied by clinical symptoms, whereas here it appears isolated to technical noise compromising signal integrity in V4 specifically. The absence of any random, high-frequency fluctuations around zero in V4—unlike what static noise might produce—instead shows perfect uniformity, but given the clinical note of static noise present overall and the unnatural flatness disrupting interpretable morphology, this constitutes evidence of noise-induced artifact rendering the lead unreadable.

Yes, this ECG shows static noise in lead V4.
