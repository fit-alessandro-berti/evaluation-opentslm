The provided ECG time series data is severely limited, capturing only the first 0.12 seconds of signal at 100 Hz with meaningful voltage variations across the 12 leads, followed by approximately 9.88 seconds of flat zero values, which likely indicates a recording artifact, equipment issue, or incomplete dataset rather than a true cardiac rhythm; this makes a comprehensive analysis challenging, especially given the clinical context of a 72-year-old female with noted baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and a pacemaker, all of which can distort interpretation. In the available segment, lead I shows a small positive deflection (0.29 mV at t=0, fluctuating to negative values like -0.28 mV at t=0.02), lead II mirrors lead I closely (suggesting possible isoelectric or low-amplitude activity), lead III displays more pronounced positive (0.40 mV) and negative (-0.48 mV) swings, aVF reaches a notable positive peak of 1.08 mV at t=0.01 before dropping to -1.14 mV, while aVL remains relatively modest and aVR shows mixed polarity; the precordial leads (V1-V6) exhibit high-amplitude spikes, such as V1's 1.52 mV positive and -1.49 mV negative, consistent with pacemaker spikes overriding intrinsic or paced QRS complexes amid noise. These patterns suggest irregular ventricular depolarization, possibly paced beats with artifacts obscuring P waves or ST segments, and intervals cannot be reliably measured due to the brevity and noise, but the limb lead polarities hint at a net inferior and slightly rightward frontal plane vector, as positive forces dominate in II, III, and aVF compared to the small or biphasic I and aVL. Overall, the morphology points to abnormal conduction influenced by the pacemaker and extrasystoles, rather than typical sinus rhythm, complicating axis assessment; however, using the classic quadrant method on the apparent main deflection directions (positive in I and aVF), the heart axis falls within the normal range of -30° to +90°.

Yes, this ECG shows a normal heart axis.
