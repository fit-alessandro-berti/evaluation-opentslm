The provided ECG time series data captures only the initial 0.12 seconds of recording, showing irregular deflections consistent with artifacts from baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode issues, and extra beats, alongside the noted pacemaker presence, which complicates precise waveform identification; however, the limb lead values reveal key patterns for axis determination, as the cardiac axis is primarily assessed using leads I and aVF to evaluate the mean QRS vector direction in the frontal plane. In lead I (representing the left-to-right horizontal axis), the predominant deflections are negative (e.g., -2.403 mV at 0.01 s, -2.565 mV at 0.02 s, -3.038 mV at 0.05 s), indicating the net QRS force is directed away from this lead toward the right. Conversely, lead aVF (inferior axis) shows a mix but with a notably positive peak (0.232 mV at 0.00 s) amid noise, suggesting a downward vector component, while lead II displays both positive (1.330 mV at 0.04 s) and negative excursions, and lead III is largely negative (-2.081 mV at 0.01 s, -2.507 mV at 0.02 s). These morphologies—negative in I and relatively preserved or positive in aVF—point to a rightward and inferior shift in the mean QRS axis, exceeding the normal range of -30° to +90° and instead falling into the left axis deviation territory of less than -30°, potentially influenced by the pacemaker's pacing mode or underlying conduction abnormalities in this 65-year-old patient, though noise limits full interval measurements like QRS duration. Left axis deviation.
