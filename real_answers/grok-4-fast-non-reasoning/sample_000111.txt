Upon examining the provided ECG time series data at 100 Hz over 10 seconds for this 86-year-old male with a pacemaker and noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, the initial 0.12 seconds of recording reveal varying voltage amplitudes across leads that suggest cardiac electrical activity, such as potential P waves, QRS complexes, or paced rhythms, but from 0.12 seconds onward, all leads abruptly flatten to exactly 0.00 mV consistently through the end of the trace, indicating a loss of signal capture rather than ongoing physiological patterns. This prolonged isoelectric line deviates from expected ECG morphology, where intervals like PR, QRS, and QT would show deflections even in paced or artifact-laden tracings, and instead points to technical failure, but regarding static noise specifically—characterized by random, high-frequency fluctuations superimposed on the baseline without coherent waveform—the initial segment shows no such erratic, non-physiological spikes or broadband interference in any particular lead, as the values appear to follow somewhat correlated patterns across limb and precordial leads consistent with early cardiac signals or initial artifacts, while the flatline period lacks any variation at all, ruling out noise there too. The clinical context mentions static noise as present overall, yet the data does not demonstrate lead-specific static noise; it may be subtle or averaged out in this sampled representation, but based on the observed patterns, no leads exhibit clear static noise.

**Final Answer:** None of the leads show discernible static noise in this ECG data.
