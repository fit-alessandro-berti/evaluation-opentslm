Given the 100 Hz sampling and the very short usable segment (≈0–0.11 s) before the trace zeros out, I reviewed lead II (most sensitive for atrial activity) and used the apparent ventricular event near 0.07–0.11 s (likely a pacing spike around 0.07 s with a subsequent wide negative deflection at 0.11 s) as a temporal anchor; the low-amplitude atrial deflection preceding this complex is visible roughly between 0.02–0.05 s with a gentle return to baseline by ~0.06 s, giving an estimated P-wave duration on the order of 40–80 ms (10 ms resolution), which remains well under the standard upper limit of 120 ms despite baseline wander, burst/static noise, electrode artifact, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker that could obscure finer atrial morphology. Final answer: within the normal range.
