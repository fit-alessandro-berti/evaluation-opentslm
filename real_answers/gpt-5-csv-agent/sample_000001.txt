Reviewing all 12 leads over the 10-second, 100 Hz recording, I first note nonphysiologic, simultaneous high-frequency deflections affecting multiple channels early in the trace; these appear as abrupt, dense, short-lived trains of rapid oscillations that do not align with any expected cardiac cycle landmarks (P waves, QRS, or T) and are not the narrow, isolated, repeatable spikes one would expect from pacemaker output, nor the slow undulations typical of baseline wander. Instead, within approximately 0.05–0.16 s there is a brief, multi-lead burst of high-amplitude, broadband activity that abruptly starts and stops and transiently obscures underlying morphology—features that are characteristic of “burst” electrical noise rather than true cardiac depolarization or repolarization; apart from this artifact, the subsequent portions of the leads regain interpretable morphology, supporting the interpretation of a transient exogenous interference episode. Final answer: yes, burst noise is present.
