Inspecting the 12-lead time series at 100 Hz, nearly the entire 10-second strip is electrically flat with only ~120 ms of non-zero signal at the beginning, after which all leads read ~0, so there is no analyzable run of P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves to establish atrial activity, ventricular depolarizations, RR intervals, or variability; I cannot identify pacemaker spikes, capture beats, pauses, AV block patterns, ectopy, or rate trends, and any apparent deflections within the brief initial segment are far too short and heavily contaminated by the reported baseline wander, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact to measure PR, QRS, or QT with any confidence—this looks like a corrupted or lead-off recording rather than genuine asystole, especially given the context of a pacemaker and “extra beats” flagged by the recorder, which I cannot corroborate from the available data. Final answer: the ECG does not allow a reliable rhythm assessment; no rhythm-related symptoms can be concluded from this tracing—repeat acquisition with proper lead contact and noise mitigation is required.
