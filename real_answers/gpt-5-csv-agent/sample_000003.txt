The 12-lead time series here is essentially non-diagnostic for ischemia: after a brief burst of high-amplitude artifact in the first ~0.1 s, all leads go electrically flat at 0 mV for the remainder of the 10-s record, so there are no consistently discernible P waves, PR intervals, QRS complexes, ST segments, or T-wave morphologies to evaluate; consequently, there are no reproducible contiguous-lead ST elevations/depressions or pathologic Q waves that would support myocardial infarction, and the prominent baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact noted in the recording metadata plausibly explain the initial spikes and subsequent signal loss rather than true ischemic patterns; given the known presence of a pacemaker and the clinical context that raises the possibility of an underlying conduction system problem (e.g., AV block or bundle-branch pathology prompting pacing) while infarction cannot be substantiated from this tracing, the finding favors a conduction disturbance.
