Across the 10-s record provided, only ~120 ms of nonzero signal is present at the beginning, after which the tracing is flat—so interval measurement and rhythm analysis are severely constrained. Within that initial window the deflection seen simultaneously in all 12 leads behaves like a single broad QRS complex with abrupt biphasic excursions and no clearly discernible preceding atrial activity; at 100 Hz sampling this spans roughly the full 12 samples available (~120 ms), suggesting a wide-complex ventricular activation rather than a narrow supraventricular one. The nearly synchronous, high-amplitude deflections across limb and precordial leads and the absence of visible isoelectric segments or PR information are compatible with paced ventricular depolarization; however, pacemaker spikes are not confidently identifiable at this sampling/scale, and heavy baseline drift and burst/static noise plus electrode artifact further obscure low-amplitude features such as P waves or pacer artifacts. Because the remainder of the strip is unavailable here, rate, regularity, axis, ST-T behavior, atrioventricular relationship, and the reported “extra beats” during the recording cannot be corroborated on this segment; premature beats, fusion/capture beats, or undersensing/oversensing remain possibilities but cannot be confirmed.

Final answer: Ventricular paced rhythm is most likely (wide QRS ≈120 ms with morphology consistent with ventricular activation), but pacer spikes are not clearly visible. Uncertain findings include absent/indiscernible P waves (underlying sinus rhythm vs atrial fibrillation vs AV dissociation cannot be determined), possible ectopy (PVCs/fusion beats) as suggested by the recording note but not demonstrable on this segment, and indeterminate ST-T segments due to severe baseline wander, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact. No reliable evidence of acute ischemia or conduction intervals (PR/QT) can be assessed from the truncated, noisy data.
