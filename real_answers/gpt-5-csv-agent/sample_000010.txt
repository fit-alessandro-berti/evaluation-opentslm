Reviewing the 10-second, 100 Hz 12-lead tracing, the waveforms show a low-frequency oscillation of the isoelectric line across multiple leads consistent with baseline drift (peak-to-peak drift roughly a few percent of overall signal amplitude), along with intermittent high-frequency, low-amplitude fuzz suggestive of static noise; there are several very narrow, multi-lead, nonphysiologic spikes clustered at the very start of the recording (≈0.00–0.08 s) that are not time-locked to any QRS and occur simultaneously in many leads, which is typical of burst noise or electrode movement at initiation, and the absence of recurring, precisely timed, needle-like spikes preceding each QRS argues against clearly visible pacemaker artifacts on this recording beyond those nonphysiologic transients; overall morphology recognition is impaired in those brief segments while the remainder of the tracing is relatively interpretable. Final answer: yes—baseline wander, static noise, brief burst noise at the start, and electrode/equipment artifacts are present.
