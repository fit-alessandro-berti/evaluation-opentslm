Inspecting the 12-lead time series, only ~0.12 s contain non-zero data before the traces collapse to flatline at 0 mV for the remainder of the 10 s recording, and the brief initial segment is contaminated by baseline wander, static/impulse noise, and electrode artifacts, precluding reliable identification of recurring P waves, QRS complexes, or stable isoelectric baselines to measure ST-segment deviation or T-wave morphology; moreover, a ventricularly paced rhythm can produce secondary repolarization changes that mimic or mask infarction patterns, and with extra beats detected plus the lack of clean, repeated beats we cannot apply paced-ECG MI criteria (e.g., Sgarbossa/Smith-modified) or assess for pathologic Q waves, reciprocal changes, or evolutionary ST/T dynamicsâ€”therefore, based on this recording alone, the ECG is non-diagnostic for infarct evolution and the stage of infarction cannot be determined. **Final answer: Indeterminate (non-diagnostic ECG; infarction stage cannot be assessed from this tracing).**
