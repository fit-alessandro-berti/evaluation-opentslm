The ECG time series data, sampled at 100 Hz over 10 seconds, shows significant activity only in the initial 0.11 seconds across all leads, with the remainder flat at zero, which is atypical for a full 12-lead recording but aligns with the noted signal quality issues including baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and extra beats, potentially indicating a focused snippet or severe artifact interference; the presence of a pacemaker suggests a paced rhythm, which often features altered ventricular depolarization patterns. In lead II, the signal commences at 0.86 mV, rapidly descends to a nadir of -1.06 mV at 0.02 s suggesting the Q wave onset, ascends to a peak of 1.81 mV at 0.04 s representing a possible R wave, dips to -0.40 mV at 0.05 s as a potential S wave, but then exhibits another rise to 1.69 mV at 0.08 s with subsequent values remaining elevated around 0.9-1.2 mV until 0.11 s before abruptly returning to baseline, implying either a single prolonged QRS complex with abnormal morphology or overlapping extra beats as mentioned in the context. Similar patterns are observed in other leads, such as V1 showing deep negative deflections early on followed by positive swings, consistent with a left bundle branch block-like appearance common in ventricular paced rhythms, where the QRS interval is frequently widened due to sequential rather than simultaneous ventricular activation. The morphology reveals irregular amplitudes and multiple peaks within this brief span, compounded by the reported noise and pacemaker influence, pointing to delayed intraventricular conduction that extends the overall depolarization phase beyond typical limits, potentially reflecting underlying cardiac conditions like bundle branch block or hypertrophic changes that prolong ventricular activation time.
