Despite the noise and artifacts, the limb-lead QRS polarities across the available segment are predominantly upright in leads I, II, III, aVL, and aVF, with lead I slightly net positive and aVF clearly net positive; this places the frontal QRS axis in the normal quadrant (roughly âˆ’30 to +90 degrees). Although aVR intermittently shows positivity (likely influenced by pacing and noise) and the recording is brief, the overall limb-lead pattern does not suggest left or right axis deviation or an extreme axis. Final answer: Yes, the heart axis appears normal.
