Inspecting lead I over the first 120 ms shows abrupt, high‑amplitude, alternating deflections (on the order of ±3–4 units) that reverse polarity within successive 10 ms samples—behavior that is nonphysiologic for a P wave or QRS complex and typical of burst/static noise or electrode motion; after 0.12 s the tracing becomes a prolonged flatline for the remainder of the 10‑second window, indicating signal dropout/lead failure rather than true electrical asystole. With these characteristics, no stable P–QRS–T morphology or intervals can be identified, and any sharp transients cannot be attributed reliably to pacemaker spikes because they do not precede consistent ventricular complexes. Final answer: lead I is dominated by severe artifact with extended dropout (flatline), rendering it uninterpretable.
