The recording shows profound technical limitations: after approximately 120 ms, all leads flatline at zero for the remainder of the 10-second trace, so only a single, noisy QRS complex is effectively captured. The morphology of that brief complex appears paced (wide, with discordant deflections across the precordium), and there is significant artifact and baseline instability; with a ventricularly paced rhythm, usual ST-T criteria for ischemia/infarction are unreliable to begin with, and in this dataset there is no evaluable isoelectric baseline, ST segment, or T wave, nor any ability to assess for evolution of Q waves, ST resolution, or T-wave inversion versus hyperacute T morphology. Intervals, rhythm, and serial comparison cannot be assessed. Given these constraints, the infarction stage cannot be determined from this ECG. Final answer: indeterminate; neither early nor middle stage can be concluded from this tracing.
