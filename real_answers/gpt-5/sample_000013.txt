Only a very brief portion of one complex is visible before the tracing becomes flat, and the recording is noted to be affected by baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact, with a pacemaker in situ and extra beats detected; together these factors substantially limit reliable interpretation. In the short visible segment, I do not see unequivocal pathologic Q waves (duration ≥30–40 ms and ≥25% of ensuing R amplitude) in two anatomically contiguous leads, nor clear QS complexes, and there is no way to assess consistent R‑wave progression across the precordium. ST segments and T waves cannot be meaningfully evaluated here due to the truncated and noisy record, and ventricular pacing (if present during the captured beats) would further invalidate standard infarct criteria. Given these constraints, there are no definitive ECG features establishing an old myocardial infarction on this tracing. Final answer: No definitive evidence of an old MI on this ECG.
