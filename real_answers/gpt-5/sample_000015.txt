Only approximately 110 ms of nonzero signal is present before the tracing becomes flatlined, and within that very brief window there is marked noise and baseline wander with no complete P–QRS–T complexes visible in any lead; with a pacemaker in situ and electrode/static/burst artifacts noted, QRS morphology is likely paced and the ST segment and T waves cannot be reliably identified or measured, precluding assessment for ST elevation or depression, reciprocal changes, T‐wave evolution, or pathological Q waves, and Sgarbossa/modified Sgarbossa criteria cannot be applied because the J point and ST segment are not discernible. Final answer: Non‑diagnostic/indeterminate; the infarction stage cannot be determined from this ECG.
