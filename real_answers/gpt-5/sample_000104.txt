The tracings show heavy noise and artifacts, and after about 0.12 s the signal is essentially absent, so interval assessment and ST–T analysis are not possible. Within the brief nonzero segment, there is a single, synchronous depolarization event with strikingly large QRS amplitudes across multiple leads (e.g., limb leads ~2.4–2.5 and precordials ~2.0 mV-equivalent in this scale), far exceeding the surrounding baseline excursions. No reliable T waves are visible after this complex due to truncation and noise, making any claim of nonspecific T-wave changes unsupported. Despite artifacts and the presence of a pacemaker, the consistently high, multilead QRS amplitudes in the available beats point toward high QRS voltage rather than T-wave abnormalities. Final answer: high qrs voltage.
