Despite baseline drift and noise, the initial depolarization is clear across multiple leads: the earliest rapid deflection begins around 0.01 s (e.g., II, V2/V6), with a sharp R peak near 0.03–0.04 s and the terminal S returning to (or crossing) baseline by about 0.06–0.07 s in aVR/V2/V6; even taking a conservative, wider offset in II gives at most ~0.08–0.10 s. With 100 Hz sampling (10 ms steps), the QRS duration therefore measures roughly 50–70 ms in most leads and ≤90–100 ms at its widest, which is within normal limits (normal up to about 100–110 ms, wide typically ≥120 ms). The morphology appears narrow rather than a paced wide complex, suggesting either atrial pacing or non-captured ventricular pacing at the sampled beat. Final answer: No.
