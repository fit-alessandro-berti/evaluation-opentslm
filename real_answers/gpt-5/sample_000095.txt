The raw tracing is brief and heavily contaminated by baseline wander, static and burst noise, and electrode motion, which limits precise measurements, but the initial 100–120 ms segment shows a very sharp, narrow pre-QRS deflection consistent with a pacing spike, immediately followed by a broad, high-amplitude, bizarre QRS complex across multiple leads, suggesting a prolonged QRS duration and an intraventricular conduction pattern typical of ventricular pacing; the ensuing repolarization appears secondarily altered with ST–T segments discordant to the major QRS deflection rather than primary ischemic morphology, and clear, consistent P waves are not evident in this snippet. Final answer: ventricular-paced QRS morphology with wide/bizarre complexes and secondary ST–T (repolarization) abnormalities.
