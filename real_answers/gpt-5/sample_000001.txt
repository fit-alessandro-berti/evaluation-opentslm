Across the initial 120 ms, the tracings display abrupt, short‑duration, high‑amplitude, synchronous transients in nearly all leads (for example around 0.08 s and 0.11 s with large simultaneous negative deflections), which are nonphysiologic for QRS morphology, do not follow a plausible cardiac cycle or pacemaker pattern, and are typical of broadband artifact bursts; the subsequent prolonged flatline suggests signal dropout/electrode issues, further indicating severe recording artifacts rather than true cardiac activity. Yes, this ECG shows burst noise.
