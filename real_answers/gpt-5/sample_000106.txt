The available ECG record contains only the first ~120 ms of signal before the trace goes flat to zero for the remainder of the 10 s, and the strip is reported to have significant baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and ventricular pacing, all of which reduce measurement reliability. Within the brief captured segment, the QRS upstroke and repolarization deflection in limb and precordial leads appear to return to baseline by roughly 0.10–0.11 s from QRS onset, implying an apparent QT of about 100–110 ms; even allowing for sampling imprecision and paced morphology, this is far shorter than the expected normal female QT/QTc (approximately 360–460 ms), so if interpreted at face value the corrected QT would be below normal, though the data quality makes this conclusion uncertain. Final answer: below the normal range.
