In lead V2 the signal in the first 0.12 s shows abrupt, non-physiologic amplitude jumps and step changes (for example a sharp positive spike around 0.03 s followed by a sudden negative deflection at 0.04 s) that do not correspond to organized P–QRS–T morphology and are typical of burst/static noise or an electrode “pop,” and then from 0.12 s onward the trace becomes a perfectly flat zero line, which indicates lead-off or signal dropout rather than true isoelectric cardiac activity; together these patterns preclude reliable interval or morphology assessment and are consistent with baseline wander, transient high-frequency noise, and electrode artifact in V2. Final answer: Yes—lead V2 is noisy, with burst/static noise and electrode/lead-off artifact.
