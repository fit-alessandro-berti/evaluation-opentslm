In lead V2, the first ~120 ms show abrupt, high-amplitude step-like deflections that reverse polarity within single samples, which is typical of transient electrode motion/burst artifacts rather than true cardiac complexes; immediately thereafter the signal drops to a sustained flat zero for the remainder of the recording, indicating lead-off/electrode disconnection and rendering intervals and morphology uninterpretable; there is no convincing 50/60-Hz hum or sustained high-frequency “muscle” fuzz, and baseline wander cannot be assessed given the immediate dropout. Final answer: burst/motion artifact at the start and prominent electrode artifact/lead-off (flatline) thereafter.
