Reviewing the 12‑lead time series at 100 Hz, I can identify what appears to be a single ventricular depolarization with large, wide deflections across multiple leads within the first ~0.06–0.11 s, consistent with a paced or ectopic QRS in a noisy segment; however, from 0.12 s onward the trace is completely flat across all leads, which strongly suggests signal dropout rather than true asystole. With only one discernible QRS complex and no subsequent beats captured, there is no measurable interval between consecutive R waves. Final answer: RR interval indeterminate (not measurable from the provided recording).
