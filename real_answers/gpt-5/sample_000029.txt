Despite baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, the QRS amplitudes are strikingly high in the leftward leads: the R wave in aVL peaks around 2.2 mV (well above the 1.1 mV aVL criterion), lead I reaches about 2.35 mV (exceeds 1.4 mV), V5 reaches roughly 3.5 mV and V6 about 7.4 mV (both exceeding the 2.6 mV criterion for V5/V6), while there are correspondingly deep S waves in the right precordials (V1–V2 on the order of ~0.8–1.0 mV), such that S(V1)+R(V5/6) easily surpasses 3.5 mV and R(aVL)+S(V3) also meets the Cornell female threshold. Final answer: tall R waves fulfilling LVH voltage are present in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 (with reciprocal deep S in V1–V2).
