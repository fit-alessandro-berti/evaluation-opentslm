The available ECG segment is extremely limited and heavily contaminated by baseline wander, burst/static noise, and electrode artifact, with near-complete signal dropout after ~0.12 s, so sustained rhythm analysis (P-wave tracking, PR, QRS/RR interval measurement) is not possible. In the brief visible portion there is an abrupt, high-frequency onset followed by a broad, high‑amplitude ventricular complex across multiple leads, a pattern compatible with pacemaker capture; the recording’s automated flags and the morphology suggest intermittent ectopy (extra beats) during the study. No sustained tachyarrhythmia or profound bradycardia can be confirmed in this trace given the artifact and truncation. Final answer: Paced rhythm with intermittent premature (extra) beats (ectopy).
