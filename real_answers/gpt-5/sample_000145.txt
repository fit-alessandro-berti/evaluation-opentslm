Focusing on lead aVL within the brief nonzero segment (≈0–0.11 s) and acknowledging baseline drift and artifacts, the QRS contour shows a small initial upward deflection (small R) around 0.01–0.03 s, followed by a larger terminal negative deflection beginning ~0.07 s and reaching its nadir near −0.47, making the complex predominantly negative; there is no convincing initial q wave, and the ST segment/T wave cannot be reliably assessed because the trace truncates to zero thereafter and noise is present. Final answer: aVL demonstrates an rS morphology with a deep terminal S wave (predominantly negative QRS).
