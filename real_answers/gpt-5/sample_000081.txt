The provided 12‑lead trace contains only about 120 ms of meaningful signal (0.00–0.11 s) followed by complete signal dropout, with baseline drift and artifact in the brief captured segment. Within that short window there appears to be a single ventricular depolarization (a single QRS complex with large R waves in the lateral precordial leads), without any definable preceding P wave, subsequent T wave, or additional cardiac cycles to establish RR timing. Because extrasystoles are diagnosed by premature occurrence relative to the expected sinus cycle (often with a different QRS/P morphology and sometimes a compensatory pause), the absence of multiple consecutive beats and the presence of artifact make it impossible to assess prematurity, compensatory pauses, or ectopic P‑wave morphologies. No wide, bizarre QRS complex or distinct early atrial beat is evident in the snippet, and no pacing spikes are clearly visible. Final answer: No clear extra systoles are identifiable on this ECG (data are insufficient to confirm any).
