Despite baseline wander, noise, artifacts, and a pacemaker, the most informative way to judge the frontal QRS axis is by the dominant QRS polarity in leads I and aVF. In the available segment with nonzero data, the steep, largest deflections consistent with QRS are predominantly upright in lead I (e.g., large positive excursions around 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, 0.11 s) and are likewise predominantly upright in aVF, with positive amplitudes exceeding the negative components. Lead II also shows predominantly positive deflections, supporting an inferior-rightward component rather than a superior “northwest” vector. Although pacing can alter QRS morphology and the signal is noisy, the net QRS polarity is not negative in both I and aVF, which effectively rules out extreme axis deviation; instead it aligns with a normal frontal plane axis. Final answer: normal heart axis.
