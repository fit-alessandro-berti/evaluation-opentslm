Inspecting lead I over the 10-second window, there are no discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves at any time; instead, the first ~120 ms show abrupt, large-amplitude, nonphysiologic deflections (e.g., sharp positive and negative spikes and step-like level changes) that occur synchronously across multiple leads, followed by a complete flatline at exactly zero for the remainder of the recording, which is incompatible with a true ECG and strongly suggests electrode/cable artifact, burst noise, and baseline instability or clipping/disconnection rather than cardiac activity. Yes, there is noise/artifact in lead I.
