Inspecting lead V4 over the first 120 ms shows abrupt, non-physiologic, high-amplitude deflections with rapid sample-to-sample swings (e.g., 0.009 at 0.00 s to −0.79 at 0.01 s, −0.50 at 0.02 s, +0.34 at 0.03 s, then large negative excursions down to −1.84 between 0.08–0.11 s) without discernible P-QRS-T morphology and occurring simultaneously across multiple leads, followed by an abrupt flatline at 0.12 s—features typical of short-duration burst noise/electrode artifact rather than true cardiac activity. Yes.
