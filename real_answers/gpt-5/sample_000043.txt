Reviewing the 12-lead time series, there are no discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves; instead, the first ~120 ms shows abrupt, simultaneous multi-lead deflections with irregular, nonphysiologic oscillations, and then the entire recording collapses to a nonbiologic flatline of zeros, indicating marked acquisition artifact and dropout. The initial rapid, jagged fluctuations superimposed across all leads and the lack of coherent cardiac morphology are characteristic of high-frequency interference consistent with static/electromagnetic noise, with additional features suggestive of burst and electrode artifacts that further obscure any true cardiac signal. Final answer: Yes.
