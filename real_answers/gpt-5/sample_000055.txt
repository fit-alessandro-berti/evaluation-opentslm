Across the first 100–110 ms, the tracings show abrupt, high‑amplitude, rapid polarity changes that occur simultaneously in multiple leads (especially V4–V6, swinging from about +6 to −6 within 10 ms), with no stable P–QRS–T morphology or measurable intervals; thereafter the signal drops out to flat zero across all leads for the remainder of the record, consistent with acquisition artifact rather than physiologic activity. Baseline drift would manifest as a low‑frequency, gradual wandering of the isoelectric line over seconds, not the brief, wideband, spiky transients and sudden signal loss seen here. Final answer: burst noise.
