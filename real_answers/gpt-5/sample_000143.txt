Despite significant baseline drift and noise, the earliest segment shows a clear depolarization-repolarization sequence across multiple leads: a sharp QRS complex begins essentially at 0.00 s with large deflections peaking around 0.01–0.02 s and resolving by about 0.05–0.06 s, followed by a low-amplitude repolarization phase that returns to baseline by roughly 0.11–0.12 s (for example, in leads II, V4–V6). This places the measured QT around 0.10–0.12 s on this tracing. Even accounting for the pacemaker and artifacts, that QT duration is not prolonged compared with usual adult norms (and would remain non-prolonged after rate correction over any physiologic RR interval). Therefore, the QT interval falls within the normal range.
