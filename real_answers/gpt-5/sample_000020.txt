The tracings show severe and pervasive artifact: after roughly 0.12 s the signal flatlines at zero across all leads, indicating channel dropout for essentially the entire 10‑second recording; within the brief nonzero window, multiple leads share nearly identical deflections at the same moments (including a large simultaneous spike around 0.10 s), which is characteristic of common-mode/electrode artifact rather than true cardiac activity. With this level of noise, baseline wander, and near-total data loss, there are no consistently discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or ST–T segments, so intervals (PR, QRS, QTc) and morphology cannot be measured, and any apparent spikes could reflect pacing artifact rather than intrinsic rhythm. Consequently, there is no reliable evidence on this tracing to support or refute specific morphology-based (“form-related”) ECG abnormalities. Final answer: No definitive form-related symptoms are demonstrable on this ECG due to noninterpretable signal.
