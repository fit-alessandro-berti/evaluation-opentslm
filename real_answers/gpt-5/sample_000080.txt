Reviewing the 12-lead time series, only the first ~120 ms contain nonzero data; after 0.12 s the tracings are flat, so we do not have a complete cardiac cycle. In lead II, the visible deflections between 0.00 and 0.11 s are consistent with components of the QRS complex (an initial small negative deflection, a prominent positive spike around 0.02â€“0.03 s, followed by a sharp negative deflection around 0.04 s and terminal negativity), which fits within the expected QRS duration but does not extend into the ST segment or T wave period that normally occurs >200 ms after QRS onset. Noise, baseline drift, and reported pacemaker presence further limit repolarization assessment, and other leads show similar truncation without a discernible T wave. Therefore, there is no reliable T-wave morphology to evaluate in lead II, and no clear inverted T-wave is demonstrable. Final answer: No.
