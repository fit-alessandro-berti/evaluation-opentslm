Only the first ~120 ms of the tracing contains nonzero data, after which all leads—including V3—are flatlined, indicating major acquisition artifact or truncation. Within that brief window, V3 fluctuates modestly (roughly from about +0.70 to −1.41) with single-step changes between 10-ms samples but without the hallmark pattern of burst noise (i.e., brief runs of high-frequency, jagged, large-amplitude spikes). In contrast, simultaneous precordial leads (especially V5–V6) show abrupt, large excursions consistent with burst noise, which are not mirrored in V3. Therefore, this ECG does not demonstrate burst noise in lead V3. Final answer: No.
