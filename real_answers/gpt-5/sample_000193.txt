The provided 10-second tracing is essentially flat from 0.12 s onward, leaving only a brief, noisy segment at 0.00–0.11 s in which a single depolarization-repolarization event may be present; there is marked baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifact, and a pacemaker is noted, all of which markedly limit repolarization assessment. In the available fragment, a sharp deflection consistent with a paced/wide QRS appears around 0.02–0.05 s followed by a broad positive deflection in lateral leads through roughly 0.08–0.10 s, but the end of the T wave cannot be delineated confidently and there is no subsequent beat to establish an RR interval for QT correction. Given the extremely limited, noisy data, and the confounding effect of a paced rhythm (for which JT rather than QT should be used), the QT interval cannot be measured reliably here and thus its relation to normal female QTc thresholds cannot be determined. Final answer: Cannot be determined.
