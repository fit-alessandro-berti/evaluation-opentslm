The provided 10-second trace contains usable data for only the first ~120 ms, after which all leads are zero, so there is no complete P–QRS–T complex to evaluate. Within the available snippet there is substantial baseline drift and artifact, with a brief, high-amplitude, near-simultaneous deflection across multiple leads around 70–80 ms that is consistent with a pacing spike/captured ventricular complex, after which the signal rapidly decays; at 100 Hz sampling and with this degree of noise and truncation, neither ST segments nor T waves can be identified or measured, and no reliable pathologic Q waves can be assessed. In a ventricularly paced rhythm, secondary ST–T changes further preclude accurate ischemia/infarction assessment even with adequate data. Therefore, there is no defensible evidence of an acute ST elevation pattern, nor can subacute or chronic infarct patterns be confirmed from this recording. Final answer: Indeterminate stage (cannot assess infarction stage due to ventricular pacing and inadequate/poor-quality ECG data).
