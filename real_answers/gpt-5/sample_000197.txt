The 12‑lead time series provided contains only about 120 ms of nonzero, highly noisy deflections followed by nearly 10 seconds of flatline (all leads at 0), consistent with severe artifact and/or data dropout rather than a physiological tracing; there are no clearly discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or RR intervals to evaluate for prematurity, compensatory pauses, or typical PAC morphology (early narrow QRS with an abnormal P wave and reset sinus timing), and any pacemaker activity—if present—is not reliably visible at this sampling. Given the absence of analyzable beats, there is no objective evidence in this record to identify supraventricular extrasystoles. Final answer: No definitive supraventricular extrasystoles are demonstrated on this ECG (non-diagnostic due to signal loss/artifact).
