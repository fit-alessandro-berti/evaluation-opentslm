On review of the provided 12‑lead time series, nearly the entire 10‑second recording is flatlined at zero after about 0.11 seconds, indicating signal dropout or disconnection, and the brief initial segment shows large, simultaneous, highly correlated deflections across many leads that do not display recognisable P–QRS–T morphology and are more consistent with burst/electrode artifact than physiologic complexes; as a result, heart rate, PR, QRS, QT intervals, rhythm, axis, and ST‑T segments cannot be measured, and ischemia, arrhythmia, conduction disease, or pacemaker function (spikes/capture) cannot be assessed from this tracing despite the metadata noting a pacemaker and “extra beats.” The appropriate course is to repeat the ECG with careful electrode prep and noise reduction and consider device interrogation if clinically indicated. Final answer: The tracing is non‑diagnostic/uninterpretable, so no cardiac abnormalities can be confirmed or excluded from this ECG.
