The available signal is too limited and noisy to support a reliable ischemic interpretation: after roughly 0.12 seconds the data in all leads flatlines to zero, leaving only a fragment that is heavily contaminated by baseline wander, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact, and the patient is noted to have a pacemaker, which further invalidates ST‑T segment analysis for infarction. Within the brief nonzero segment, there is at most a single complex with large deflections but no consistent, measurable PR, QRS, or QT intervals, no ability to establish an isoelectric baseline, and no reproducible ST elevation/depression, T‑wave inversion, or pathologic Q waves in contiguous leads; extra beats cannot be meaningfully characterized, and paced complexes can mask or mimic ischemic morphology. Given these factors, this ECG is not interpretable for diagnosing an evolving (“middle stage”) myocardial infarction, and there is no definitive ECG evidence of subacute MI on the trace provided. Final answer: No, this ECG does not demonstrate the middle stage of myocardial infarction (the tracing is non-diagnostic); repeat a high‑quality 12‑lead and correlate with troponins and clinical findings.
