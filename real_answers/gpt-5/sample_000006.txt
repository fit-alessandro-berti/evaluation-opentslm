The provided 12‑lead time series is dominated by nonphysiologic behavior and data dropout: the first ~120 ms show simultaneous large, same‑polarity deflections across nearly all leads and even identical lead values at times, patterns far more consistent with electrode artifact/burst noise than true cardiac vectors, and from ~0.12 s onward every lead is exactly zero, indicating signal loss rather than asystole. With this extent of baseline wander, static and burst noise, and electrode artifact—combined with the very low sampling (100 Hz) that would also obscure pacemaker spikes—no reliable P waves, QRS complexes, ST segments, or intervals can be identified, so morphology‑based (form‑related) assessment is not possible from this recording; a repeat ECG with improved electrode contact and higher sampling is required. Final answer: No interpretable form‑related symptoms can be determined on this ECG due to severe artifacts and data loss.
