The analyzable portion of this very short, noisy tracing appears to show a single ventricularly paced or wide QRS complex with a prominent initial R deflection followed by a sustained positive plateau consistent with ST-segment elevation relative to the preceding baseline (e.g., around 0.02 s the trace is near isoelectric/negative, then after the QRS at ~0.06 s it remains distinctly elevated in several limb and precordial leads). I do not see clear, stable, deep pathologic Q waves across a consistent territory that would point to an old infarct pattern, and there is no opportunity to appreciate chronic T-wave inversions given the truncated window. While paced rhythms can produce secondary ST-T changes, the apparent concordant ST elevation relative to the QRS polarity favors an acute injury current rather than a remote infarct scar pattern. Early stage of myocardial infarction.
