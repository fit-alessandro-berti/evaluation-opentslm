Given the marked noise, baseline wander, extra beats, and ventricular pacing (which can produce secondary ST–T discordance), I focused on the isoelectric PR segment and the ST level about 60–80 ms after the J point across available beats rather than single-sample excursions. Despite artifacts, the inferior and anterolateral precordial leads show ST segments that sit below baseline without clear ischemic morphology (not clearly horizontal or downsloping in a contiguous coronary territory and occurring in a paced rhythm), consistent with nonspecific ST depression rather than regional ischemia. The depression is most evident in the inferior aVF and across the precordial leads with a gradient that is greatest laterally, particularly V4–V6, with milder depression extending into V2–V3. Final answer: aVF, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6.
