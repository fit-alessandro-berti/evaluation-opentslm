The recording is severely limited by noise, artifacts, and truncation, but focusing on the early portion where a premature complex is visible, the ectopic beat occurs earlier than expected, shows a distinctly different and broader QRS morphology compared with the surrounding complexes, lacks an identifiable preceding P wave, and is followed by a compensatory pause; these features favor a ventricular origin over an atrial or junctional focus (which would typically have a preceding P wave and a narrow QRS unless conducted with aberrancy). The presence of a pacemaker does not explain this morphology, as there is no clear pacing spike nor a paced-looking QRS at the time of the ectopic, arguing against a pacemaker-mediated fusion or pseudofusion beat. Final answer: ventricular extrasystole (PVC).
