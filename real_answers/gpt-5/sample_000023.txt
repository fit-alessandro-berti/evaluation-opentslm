The provided 10-second, 100 Hz ECG trace is dominated by baseline drift, noise, and electrode artifact, and after about 0.12 s the signal is essentially flat, leaving only a single QRS–T complex to examine, which precludes measuring RR variability or establishing a repeating atrial pattern; within the brief visible segment there are no repetitive “sawtooth” flutter waves in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) or V1, and there is no evidence of the rapid, regular atrial activity (≈250–350 bpm) or fixed AV conduction ratios characteristic of atrial flutter, whereas the limited morphology that is visible appears consistent with a single sinus-conducted beat and not with flutter; given the absence of flutter-defining features and the patient’s age where respiratory-related variability is common, the rhythm finding here aligns with sinus arrhythmia. Final answer: sinus arrhythmia.
