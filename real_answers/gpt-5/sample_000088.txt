Inspecting the first 120 ms of the recording, the limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) show relatively modest, smoother amplitude excursions consistent with physiologic complexes and mild artifact, whereas the precordial leads demonstrate rapid, large-amplitude, alternating deflections from sample to sample that lack coherent P–QRS–T morphology, a pattern characteristic of high-frequency “static” noise; thereafter, all channels drop to zero, indicating data dropout rather than ongoing static interference. Static noise is present in leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6.
