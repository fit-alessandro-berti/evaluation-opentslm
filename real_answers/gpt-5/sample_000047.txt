Despite the heavy artifact and the very short non-zero segment, the premature complex that is visible shows a broad, bizarre QRS morphology across multiple leads without a clearly preceding P wave and with marked discordance of ST-T direction, which argues against a supraventricular origin with normal conduction; in the context of a pacemaker, no reliable pacing spike can be discerned at this sampling rate, and the QRS configuration is more consistent with a ventricular origin than with a conducted PAC or PJC with aberrancy. Final answer: premature ventricular extrasystole (PVC).
