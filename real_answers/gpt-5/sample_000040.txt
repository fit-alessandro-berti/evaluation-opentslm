Inspecting lead V3 over the available samples, the first 110 ms show abrupt, large-amplitude excursions consistent with QRS activity and significant artifact (including a pronounced spike around 0.06–0.07 s), followed immediately by a prolonged flatline at zero from 0.12 s onward. Baseline drift would manifest as a slow, low-frequency wandering of the isoelectric line over seconds, typically visible between beats; that pattern is not demonstrable here—there is no gradual baseline shift, only brief high-frequency noise/artifact followed by signal dropout. Therefore, within the provided V3 data, baseline drift is not evident. No.
