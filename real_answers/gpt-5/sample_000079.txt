Inspecting lead V2 over the brief segment with signal (0–0.12 s) shows marked instability of the baseline with abrupt, nonphysiologic amplitude swings (for example, from −0.89 to +0.88 mV and then to −1.47 mV within a few samples) that do not resemble organized P–QRS–T morphology and are most consistent with transient spike-like disturbances; additionally, the baseline itself meanders over this short interval rather than remaining steady, suggesting low-frequency wander, and there is fine, irregular fluctuation superimposed on the trace consistent with high-frequency (static) noise; at 0.12 s the signal in V2 (and in all leads) abruptly drops to an exact flat zero, which is characteristic of electrode/lead-off artifact or a recording interruption rather than true cardiac silence, making interval and morphology assessment impossible. Final answer: lead V2 demonstrates baseline drift (wander), high-frequency/static noise, transient burst noise (spikes), and electrode artifact/lead-off (abrupt flatline).
