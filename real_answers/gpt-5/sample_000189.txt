Despite the baseline drift, noise, and pacemaker artifacts, the limb-lead QRS polarity remains predominantly upright in leads I, II, III, and aVF, with only brief negative deflections that do not outweigh the overall positive net QRS. A positive QRS in both lead I and aVF indicates a frontal plane axis between 0 and +90 degrees, and there is no pattern of negativity in aVF (which would suggest left axis deviation) or in lead I (which would suggest right axis deviation). Therefore, this ECG shows a normal axis (no deviation).
