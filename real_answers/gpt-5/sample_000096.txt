In lead V6 over the brief nonzero segment (0.00–0.11 s), the trace shows isolated, abrupt excursions (for example, sharp positive deflections at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.05 s) superimposed on an otherwise relatively smooth, slowly varying baseline that trends negative, followed by complete signal dropout to zero for the remainder of the recording; there is no persistent, fine, high‑frequency oscillation riding across the waveform that would indicate continuous static noise. These short, transient, high‑amplitude perturbations—especially when simultaneous across multiple leads—are more consistent with intermittent artifact bursts (e.g., electrode or movement/pacer-related) rather than ongoing static interference. Final answer: burst noise.
