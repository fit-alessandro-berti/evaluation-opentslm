The provided 12‑lead signal contains only about 120 ms of nonzero data followed by a flatline, with marked baseline drift and noise, and the presence of a pacemaker further complicates morphology assessment at the 100 Hz sampling rate. Within the brief visible segment, there is at most a single transient deflection that could represent part of a QRS complex, but there is no complete cardiac cycle to evaluate for prematurity, QRS duration, axis, absence of preceding P wave, or a compensatory pause—all essential features to diagnose ventricular extrasystoles. No repetitive wide QRS complexes or ectopic patterns (bigeminy, couplets, runs) are discernible, and pacing spikes cannot be reliably identified at this sampling rate. Therefore, based on the available tracing, there is no definitive evidence of ventricular extrasystoles. Final answer: No.
