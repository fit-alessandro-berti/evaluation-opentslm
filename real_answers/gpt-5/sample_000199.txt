On inspection of the provided time series, only the first ~120 ms contain nonzero data and that segment is dominated by large, simultaneous deflections across all leads at ~60 ms and ~100 ms (likely clipping/artifact and/or pacer-related spikes), followed immediately by a flatline of zeros for the remaining ~9.9 seconds. There is no complete, clearly interpretable cardiac cycle with an identifiable QRS complex followed by a measurable T wave, and the noted baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifacts further obscure morphology. In addition, the presence of a pacemaker means any paced QRS would be wide with secondary repolarization changes, for which QT is not a reliable metric and JT would be preferredâ€”yet the T wave is not discernible here. Because the T-wave end cannot be identified and the tracing is truncated/overwritten by noise and zeros, neither QT nor a corrected QT (QTc) can be measured or validated from this recording. Final answer: indeterminate; the QT interval cannot be assessed on this ECG, so whether it is within the normal range cannot be determined.
