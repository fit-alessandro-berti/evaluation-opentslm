Given the heavy baseline drift and noise, I focused on the earliest nonzero segment where lead III shows a clear sequence: an initial negative deflection (at ~0.01–0.02 s) consistent with a small Q wave, a brief small positive upstroke (R) around 0.03–0.04 s, followed by a much larger negative deflection (S) that dominates thereafter (values reaching roughly −1.8). This yields a predominantly negative QRS with small initial R and very deep S; ST–T segments cannot be reliably assessed in this truncated, noisy snippet, and pacer spikes are not discernible at this sampling. Final answer: lead III demonstrates a qRS morphology with a very deep S wave (predominantly negative QRS).
