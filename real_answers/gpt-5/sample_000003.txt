The trace is dominated by severe artifacts and data loss: after about 120 ms virtually all leads are flatlined at zero, making it impossible to evaluate rate, rhythm over multiple cycles, PR/QRS/QT intervals, or STâ€“T segments. In the brief nonzero segment there are abrupt, high-amplitude, near-synchronous deflections across multiple leads that are more consistent with pacing artifacts followed by a captured ventricular complex than with ischemic ST-segment morphology; no consistent ST elevation/depression or pathologic Q waves can be assessed over time due to truncation and noise. The provided metadata also notes a pacemaker and extra beats, which further implies an abnormal activation pattern and confounds MI assessment. Given the visible paced/aberrant activation and the inability to reliably assess ischemic changes, this recording supports a conduction disturbance rather than myocardial infarction.
