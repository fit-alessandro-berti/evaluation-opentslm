I reviewed the waveforms lead-by-lead and over time and found that nearly the entire 10‑second recording is flatlined at 0 after about 0.12 seconds, with only a very brief, noise‑contaminated segment at the beginning that shows large, simultaneous, identical deflections across all leads (for example at 0.02 s every lead is 0.639), a pattern that is nonphysiologic and typical of artifact rather than true cardiac activity; additional sharp, brief deflections and baseline shifts in the first 120 ms could represent pacing spikes or burst/static noise and electrode artifact, but the morphology is inconsistent and too short to define P waves, QRS complexes, PR intervals, QRS duration, QT/QTc, rhythm, axis, or ST‑T segments in a diagnostic way. Given the documented pacemaker, there might be pacing spikes/capture and “extra beats,” but they cannot be distinguished from artifact in this trace; there are no reliable ischemic ST‑T changes or arrhythmic patterns that can be confirmed because of data loss and heavy noise. Final answer: Nondiagnostic due to severe artifact and truncation; uncertain findings include possible pacing spikes/ventricular-paced complexes and possible ectopy, but these cannot be confirmed—repeat a high‑quality 12‑lead ECG and consider pacemaker interrogation.
