Baseline drift is a low‑frequency wandering of the isoelectric line over seconds, typically appreciated between complexes rather than within the rapid QRS deflections. In lead aVF here, usable data exist only for the first ~120 ms, after which the signal is flat at zero across the remaining 10 s, which represents dropout rather than physiologic baseline motion. Within the brief nonzero segment, the rapid, large swings (from approximately +2.3 to −1.8 to +2.5 mV within tens of milliseconds) are consistent with intra-beat depolarization and noise but do not show a slow, gradual shift of the baseline. Given the lack of sustained, low‑frequency trend and the subsequent signal loss, baseline drift in aVF is not demonstrable in this recording. Final answer: No.
