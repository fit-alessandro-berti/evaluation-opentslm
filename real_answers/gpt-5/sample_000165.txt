In lead V6 the initial ~0.1 s shows nonphysiologic, abrupt amplitude jumps with brief spikes and step-like baseline shifts that obscure normal P–QRS–T morphology, followed by a prolonged flatline at exactly zero from ~0.12 s to the end, which is most consistent with electrode/lead-off artifact and signal dropout; the early segment also demonstrates transient, high-frequency jitter compatible with static noise, and sudden transient excursions compatible with burst noise, with slow baseline wandering evident in the stepwise offset changes, making interval or ischemic assessment impossible. Final answer: baseline drift, high-frequency “static” noise, burst/transient noise, and electrode/lead-off artifact (including dropout/flatline) in V6.
