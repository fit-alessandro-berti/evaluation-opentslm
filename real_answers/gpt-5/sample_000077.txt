Although the recording is very brief and noisy, there is an early ectopic complex with a markedly abnormal, broad and “bizarre” QRS morphology across multiple leads, without a clearly preceding P wave and without a visible pacemaker spike, and with pronounced discordant deflections in the precordials—features that favor a ventricular origin rather than a supraventricular ectopic with normal conduction; in a paced patient this pattern is most consistent with a native ventricular premature beat rather than a paced or junctional event, which would typically be narrow or show a pacing spike. Final answer: ventricular extrasystole (PVC).
