Across the first 120 ms, the tracing shows a single, near-synchronous, large deflection in most leads (positive around 0.06–0.07 s, with preceding and/or following global negative swings), which is more consistent with artifact or a solitary depolarization than with a clearly formed P–QRS–T sequence; beyond 0.12 s, all leads are flatlined at 0, indicating loss of signal for the remainder of the 10 s window and precluding assessment of rhythm, rate, axis, PR/QRS/QT intervals, or ST–T morphology. With this severe baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, and complete data dropout after the first 120 ms, the study is uninterpretable for normality; moreover, in a 72-year-old with a pacemaker and reported extra beats, a genuinely normal ECG would require organized sinus activity without pacing spikes or abnormal beats, which is not demonstrable here. No.
