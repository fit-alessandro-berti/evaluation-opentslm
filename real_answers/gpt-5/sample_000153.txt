Inspecting V1 over the first 120 ms, there are abrupt, nonphysiologic step-like deflections and large transient spikes that obscure any recognizable P–QRS–T morphology, followed immediately by complete signal dropout to a flat line for the remainder of the tracing, which indicates a lead-off/electrode artifact rather than a cardiac phenomenon; the early sequence also shows rapid baseline shifts consistent with motion-related baseline wander, and the sharp, high-amplitude impulses are typical of burst (impulsive) noise, while there is no convincing continuous 50/60 Hz sinusoidal hum to suggest powerline interference and no clear EMG-like high-frequency fuzz. Final answer: electrode artifact with lead-off/dropout, burst (impulsive) noise, and baseline drift in V1.
