Despite the noisy, truncated tracing and presence of ventricular pacing, the dominant QRS deflection in the brief available segment appears upright in lead I and becomes predominantly positive in the inferior leads (aVF is small negative early but clearly positive during the main deflection), while aVR shows biphasic to positive deflection that could be due to pacing vector or lead/noise artifact; the key criterion for “extreme axis” is simultaneous predominantly negative QRS in both lead I and aVF (northwest axis), which is not met here. Final answer: No, this ECG does not show extreme axis deviation.
