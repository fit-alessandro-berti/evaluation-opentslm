The brief, noisy segment that is not flatlined shows upright QRS deflections in both lead I and the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), suggesting a normal-to-rightward frontal plane axis rather than the marked left axis deviation typical of left anterior fascicular block; there is no clear rS pattern in the inferior leads nor a qR in I/aVL, and the QRS duration cannot be reliably measured given the limited, artifact-laden snippet and the presence of a pacemaker. Likewise, there are no convincing pathologic Q waves in the inferior leads and no evaluable ST-segment deviations to support an inferior myocardial infarction. With substantial baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats, and pacemaker activity, diagnostic interpretation is constrained. Final answer: Uncertain; no definitive evidence of left anterior fascicular block or inferior lead myocardial infarction on this recording.
