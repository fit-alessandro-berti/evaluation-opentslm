The first fraction of a second shows marked artifact with abrupt baseline shifts and identical deflections across multiple leads (e.g., I and II are numerically the same at several instants, and Einthoven’s law is violated with I + III ≠ II), and augmented leads show implausible relationships; these cross‑lead redundancies strongly suggest limb lead misconnection or poor contact rather than true cardiac signals. Immediately thereafter, all 12 leads go to an exact 0 mV flatline for the remainder of the recording, which is physiologically impossible and indicates complete signal dropout consistent with electrode/cable detachment or a recording failure. Given the profound inconsistency across leads and the prolonged flatline, this tracing is not reliable for cardiac interpretation and is dominated by electrode-related issues. Yes.
