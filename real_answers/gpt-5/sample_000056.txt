Across the first 120 ms, the tracings show simultaneous, nonphysiologic, high‑amplitude deflections and stepwise shifts in all leads rather than organized P–QRS–T morphology, pointing to electrode motion/artifact; there is superimposed irregular jitter consistent with broadband/static noise; the signal then abruptly drops to a uniform flatline at zero in every lead for the remainder of the recording, indicating a transient dropout/lead-off event typical of burst noise; the slight low‑frequency baseline shifts in the brief initial segment suggest baseline wander as well. Final answer: baseline drift (wander), static/broadband noise, burst/transient noise with dropout, and electrode motion artifacts.
