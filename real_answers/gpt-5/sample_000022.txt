The recording shows severe artifact and near-complete signal dropout after ~0.12 s, so rate, PR, QT/QTc, and beat-to-beat variability cannot be reliably assessed. Within the brief segment that is visible, a single narrow QRS complex is present across multiple leads: in lead II the rapid deflection begins around 0.02 s, peaks at 0.04 s, and largely resolves by ~0.06–0.07 s, giving an estimated QRS duration of roughly 40–50 ms, which is narrow. The frontal QRS axis appears normal: at the QRS peak (≈0.04 s) both lead I (≈+2.11) and aVF (≈+2.07) are strongly positive, and the ratio aVF/I ≈0.98 corresponds to an axis near +45°, within the normal range (−30° to +90°). The terminal T deflection in this beat is also upright in I and aVF (e.g., around 0.10 s: I ≈+0.23, aVF ≈+0.36), giving a T-wave axis of arctan(0.36/0.23) ≈+55°, which is also a normal T axis. Final answer: normal numeric features identifiable here are a narrow QRS duration (~40–50 ms, normal <120 ms), a normal frontal QRS axis (≈+45°, normal −30° to +90°), and a normal T-wave axis (≈+55°).
