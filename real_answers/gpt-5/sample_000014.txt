The provided 10-second trace effectively contains only about 120 ms of nonzero data followed by flatline, with baseline wander, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats flagged, and a pacemaker presentâ€”all of which make ST-segment and T-wave interpretation unreliable. What is visible appears to be fragments of a single paced/wide QRS complex with large, discordant deflections that vary by lead and timing; there is no stable isoelectric baseline or sustained ST segment from which to judge true ST elevation or depression, and no consistent pattern of inferior ST elevation with lateral involvement or reciprocal anterior depression to support an inferoposterolateral transmural infarction. Likewise, there is no reproducible, diffuse horizontal ST depression across the inferior and lateral leads with reciprocal aVR ST elevation to confidently call subendocardial ischemia; any apparent deviations occur within the QRS in a paced context, where secondary repolarization changes can mimic ischemia and should not be overinterpreted. Given the severely limited, noisy, and paced tracing without analyzable ST segments, the distinction cannot be made with confidence; if forced to choose, the findings lean more toward subendocardial injury in inferolateral leads, but this is uncertain.
