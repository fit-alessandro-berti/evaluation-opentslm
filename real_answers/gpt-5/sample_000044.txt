The 12‑lead tracing here is largely uninterpretable beyond the first 0.1–0.12 seconds due to substantial artifact and then near-complete signal dropout, so standard interval measurements (PR, QRS, QT) and true ST‑segment/T‑wave assessment are not feasible. In the very brief visible portion there is no consistent, discernible P–QRS–T morphology to anchor an ST‑segment baseline, and with a documented pacemaker present, any ventricular activation when captured would be expected to be abnormal and wide with secondary repolarization changes that make primary ischemic ST/T analysis unreliable. Given the clinical metadata indicating pacing and extra beats, and the absence of clear, sustained ST deviations but a context prone to altered depolarization, the finding is more consistent with conduction disturbance. Final answer: conduction disturbance.
