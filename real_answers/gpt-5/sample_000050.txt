The available signal contains only about 120 ms of nonzero data followed by complete signal dropout (all leads at 0) for the remainder of the 10-second recording, consistent with major electrode artifact or lead/device disconnect; within the brief initial segment there is prominent noise and abrupt deflections across several leads that could represent a single QRS complex or artifact, but there are no consistently identifiable P waves, no measurable PR/QRS/QT intervals, and no reliable STâ€“T assessment, and although a pacemaker is reportedly present, pacing spikes and capture cannot be confidently identified in this trace; therefore no definitive diagnostic abnormalities can be concluded, with only uncertain features including a possible pacing-related artifact or ectopic beat in the first 120 ms, so overall this ECG is non-diagnostic due to technical failure and shows no definite diagnostic symptoms.
