Reviewing the first 120 ms of the tracing, the baseline wanders slowly between negative and positive deflections across multiple leads, indicating low-frequency drift; superimposed on that are fine, high-frequency oscillations consistent with static-like interference. There are also abrupt, large-amplitude transient spikes in the early samples suggestive of burst or “pop” noise. Immediately thereafter (from about 0.12 s onward) all leads collapse to a flatline at zero, which is not physiologic and strongly indicates electrode motion/lead-off artifact or channel dropout, fitting with electrode-related artifacts rather than true cardiac silence. Taken together, this recording demonstrates baseline drift, static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts.
