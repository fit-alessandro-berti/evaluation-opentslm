In lead aVL, the brief nonzero segment (0–0.11 s) shows abrupt, large-amplitude excursions with polarity reversals consistent with burst noise or electrode artifact rather than a slow, respiratory-frequency baseline wander; thereafter the tracing is essentially flat at 0.00 for the remainder of the 10 s, precluding assessment of gradual isoelectric shift over time. No stable P–QRS–T morphology or isoelectric segments are available to track a slow drift, and what is visible lacks the characteristic gradual wandering baseline. No.
