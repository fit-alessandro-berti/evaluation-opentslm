Despite the heavy artifact, very short analyzable segment, and confounding paced rhythm, the single captured complex shows no clear, consistent convex ST-segment elevation across contiguous leads to suggest ongoing acute injury; instead, after an initial deflection the terminal portion is predominantly negative with deep, symmetric T-wave inversion in multiple leads (notably across the precordials and limb leads), and there are no unequivocal pathologic Q waves identifiable in this truncated beat. This pattern—T-wave inversion with minimal or resolving ST shift—fits best with the evolving/post-injury phase rather than hyperacute (peaked T/early ST elevation) or chronic (Q-wave–dominant, normalized T) states. Final answer: subacute/evolving infarction stage.
