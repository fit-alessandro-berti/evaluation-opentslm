Inspecting the raw traces, there is no coherent, physiologic P–QRS–T morphology. The very brief initial segment (first ~0.12 s) shows abrupt, synchronous amplitude jumps across many leads with identical values and polarity changes that are not biologically plausible, suggesting high-frequency interference and burst artifacts rather than cardiac activity; the baseline also shifts irregularly, consistent with baseline wander. Immediately thereafter, all 12 leads become exactly 0.000 for the remainder of the 10‑s recording, which cannot represent true asystole simultaneously in every lead and instead indicates lead-off/electrode disconnect or acquisition failure with zero-filled data. Because of these artifacts and data dropout, intervals and rhythm (including any pacemaker spikes or ectopy) cannot be reliably assessed. Final answer: Yes—this ECG is markedly contaminated by noise, including baseline drift, high-frequency/static and burst noise, and electrode/lead-disconnect artifacts.
