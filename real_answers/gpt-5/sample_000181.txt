Examining the aVF trace over time, only the first ~110 ms contain nonzero values, with small fluctuating deflections followed by a simultaneous large negative excursion across most leads at 0.11 s that is most consistent with artifact; from 0.12 s onward the signal is flat (zeros), so there is no complete cardiac cycle to identify the ST–T segment or a T wave. Given the substantial baseline drift, static and electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, T‑wave morphology cannot be reliably delineated, and there is no discernible T wave following a QRS in aVF within the available data window. Therefore, there is no demonstrable evidence of T‑wave inversion in lead aVF on this recording. Final answer: No.
