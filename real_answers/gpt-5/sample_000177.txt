Despite noise and artifacts, the frontal-plane QRS axis can be inferred from the initial segment with signal: lead I shows a clear net positive QRS deflection (predominantly positive amplitudes after a brief early negativity), and aVF is also net positive overall, placing the mean QRS axis between 0° and +90°. Lead II mirrors positivity as well, which further supports a normal inferior-leftward orientation rather than a leftward (I positive, aVF negative) or rightward (I negative, aVF positive) deviation; although a pacemaker is noted, the observed frontal QRS polarity pattern still aligns with a normal axis. Final answer: Normal axis (no deviation).
