The tracing is dominated by severe artifact and an extensive signal dropout (flatline) after ~0.12 s, so only a very brief initial segment is interpretable; within that short window there are large-amplitude, broad complexes with secondary, globally discordant ST/T morphology typical of ventricular activation not via the His–Purkinje system (ventricular pacing), and the beat-to-beat timing in this snippet suggests at least one ectopic/extra beat, while consistent P waves are not discernible and ST-segment assessment for ischemia is unreliable in this context due to baseline drift and burst/static noise. Final answer: Ventricular-paced rhythm with wide QRS and secondary ST–T changes; ventricular ectopic (extra) beats; recording quality poor/non-diagnostic for ischemia or precise interval measurement.
