In lead V5, the tracing over the brief available segment shows abrupt, irregular, high‑frequency swings in amplitude with rapid polarity changes within tens of milliseconds and no coherent P–QRS–T morphology, which is far faster than physiologic intervals; the baseline itself does not slowly wander over time, as would be expected with low‑frequency baseline drift. Final answer: static noise.
