The provided 12‑lead time series contains only about 120 ms of nonzero signal followed by a flatline at zero for the remainder of the 10‑second recording, so there is not enough continuous data to evaluate rhythm. In the brief visible segment, there appears to be a single depolarization complex with subsequent repolarization, but baseline drift and noise make small deflections hard to trust, and there are no serial R–R intervals to assess for the hallmark irregularly irregular ventricular response of atrial fibrillation. Likewise, a fibrillatory baseline and consistent absence of P waves cannot be determined from a single beat, and paced spikes (which can be very brief and filtered at 100 Hz) are not clearly identifiable. Given the truncation and artifacts, atrial fibrillation cannot be diagnosed from this tracing; therefore, based on the available data, this ECG does not show atrial fibrillation.
