Only a brief portion of the 10-second tracing contains usable signal and it is contaminated by baseline drift, burst/static noise, and electrode artifact, with a pacemaker present, so any interpretation is necessarily cautious; within the available beat, the precordial leads V1–V3 show an apparent upward shift of the ST segment after the QRS with amplitudes in V1–V2 approaching 0.8–1.0 mV and a plateau-like contour 60–80 ms after the J point, whereas the inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5–V6, I, aVL) do not demonstrate convincing horizontal/downsloping ST depression consistent with diffuse subendocardial ischemia (and the isolated aVR positivity is not accompanied by the expected widespread ST depression); while paced or conducted beats can produce secondary ST-T changes that mimic injury, the pattern here is more consistent with localized anterior/septal injury than with diffuse subendocardial changes. Final answer: myocardial infarction in anteroseptal leads, but with low confidence given noise and pacing (uncertain).
