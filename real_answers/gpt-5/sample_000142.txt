The recording is severely compromised: after roughly 0.11 s all leads flatline, leaving only a brief, noisy fragment with baseline wander and large, nonphysiologic deflections that likely reflect artifact rather than discrete cardiac cycles. Within the visible segment I cannot reliably delineate P waves, measure PR or RR intervals, or identify a repeating sequence of a normal beat followed by a premature complex at a fixed coupling interval; there are no consistent wide, premature QRS complexes alternating with normal ones to suggest ventricular bigeminy, nor a recurring pattern of premature narrow complexes to suggest supraventricular bigeminy. Pacemaker spikes are not clearly seen, and the data are insufficient to determine ectopic origin. In the absence of a demonstrable alternating premature-normal sequence, the tracing does not show bigeminal pattern; sinus rhythm.
