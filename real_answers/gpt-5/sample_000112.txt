Across the first 120 ms, the limb leads show abrupt, high‑frequency, sample‑to‑sample swings inconsistent with physiologic waveforms, with I and II even tracking identically (suggesting common-mode artifact), and aVR/aVL exhibiting large alternating polarity excursions approaching saturation; by contrast, the precordial leads are comparatively smoother. The remainder of the recording is zeros, indicating dropout and reinforcing that early variation reflects noise rather than true cardiac morphology. Final answer: static noise is present in the limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF.
