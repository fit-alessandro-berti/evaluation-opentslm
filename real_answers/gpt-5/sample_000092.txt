At 100 Hz over 10 seconds, there appears to be a single ventricular complex around 0.09â€“0.11 s (prominent deflection in II/aVF), after which all leads are essentially flat through the end of the recording, consistent with either a profound pause/asystole or data drop-out; no recurrent QRS complexes are visible to allow calculation of a short RR, and given the absence of subsequent beats, any inferred RR would be markedly prolonged rather than shortened. Although baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a pacemaker are noted (and pacing artifacts are not clearly discernible in this short initial segment), nothing here supports a tachycardic, sub-600 ms RR interval; if anything, the interval is unmeasurable or excessively long. No.
