The visible portion of the tracing is brief and noisy, with baseline wander, static, and electrode artifacts, and the patient has a pacemaker, all of which complicate ST‑segment interpretation and can produce secondary ST‑T abnormalities. The single discernible complex shows large, likely paced QRS deflections with subsequent modest ST/T deviations that vary in direction across multiple leads without a consistent regional pattern. Critically, there is no clear, sustained J‑point/ST elevation meeting criteria in two contiguous inferior leads (II, III, aVF) with supportive reciprocal changes, nor in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6); instead, the deviations are small, inconsistent, and diffuse, which fits repolarization changes from pacing/artifact rather than localized ischemia or infarction. Final answer: non-specific ST changes.
