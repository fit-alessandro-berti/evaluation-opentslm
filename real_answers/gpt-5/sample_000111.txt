Reviewing the first 100–110 ms of the tracing (after which the recording drops out to zeros across all leads, consistent with data loss/electrode artifact), there are rapid, nonphysiologic, sample-to-sample amplitude changes with no discernible P–QRS–T morphology, occurring synchronously across the limb (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) and precordial (V1–V6) leads. This broadband, high‑frequency jitter is characteristic of static noise rather than true cardiac activity, and its simultaneous appearance in multiple leads indicates a global interference rather than a localized lead problem. Final answer: static noise is present in all 12 leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1–V6).
