Despite the noisy, artifact-laden, and very brief limb-lead segment, the dominant deflection of the QRS in the inferior leads (II and aVF) is predominantly negative, while lead I/aVL show early positive components (with I variably biphasic but demonstrating an initial leftward vector) consistent with a superiorly directed frontal plane axis rather than one pointing inferiorly; in the context of a likely paced, wide-complex morphology (precordial swings, LBBB-like pattern), this pattern favors a leftward axis over a normal one. Final answer: left axis deviation.
