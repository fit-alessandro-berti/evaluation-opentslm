This tracing is heavily contaminated by baseline wander and noise and appears to include paced beats, which complicates ST–T interpretation, but looking across the precordial leads the most consistent pattern is relative ST depression in the septal/anterior distribution (V1–V3/V4) with less conspicuous ST shift in the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6); there is no reproducible lateral ST elevation or a clear anterolateral ischemic signature, and the lateral leads do not show a dominant ischemic pattern compared with the anterior septal leads. In the context of a paced QRS, this comparatively greater horizontal ST depression in the anteroseptal leads supports a subendocardial injury pattern localized to the anteroseptal territory rather than an anterolateral ischemic pattern. Final answer: subendocardial injury in anteroseptal leads.
