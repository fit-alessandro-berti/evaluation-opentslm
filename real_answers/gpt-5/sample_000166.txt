The recording provides only about 120 ms of usable signal followed by near-complete signal dropout; within that brief window there are multiple abrupt, high-amplitude, near-simultaneous deflections across all leads and a single sample that saturates identically negative in every lead, which is typical of pacing artifact and/or amplifier saturation rather than true cardiac depolarization. There is no consistent P–QRS–T morphology, no reproducible R–R intervals, and the apparent “repetitive complexes” occur at physiologically impossible cycle lengths for myocardium, indicating noise/burst artifact and electrode disturbance. Given the pacemaker history, the isolated sharp deflection could represent a pacing spike, but capture, underlying intrinsic rhythm, and any ectopy cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the rhythm is not interpretable due to severe artifact and signal dropout; the only rhythm-related finding is pacing artifact, with no definitive arrhythmia demonstrable.
