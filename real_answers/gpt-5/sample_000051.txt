Across the first ~0.1 s, the tracing shows low-frequency baseline shifts and slow undulations consistent with baseline drift, with superimposed fine, high-frequency jitter suggesting static (high-frequency) noise; there are also abrupt, large, simultaneous excursions across multiple leads around 0.06–0.08 s consistent with transient burst/impulse noise and movement/electrode artifact. Immediately thereafter (from ~0.12 s onward) all leads flatline at zero, which is characteristic of an electrode/lead-off artifact or complete signal dropout rather than true asystole, further supporting electrode-related interference. Final answer: baseline drift (wander), static (high‑frequency) noise, burst/impulse noise, and electrode artifacts (including lead-off/poor contact).
