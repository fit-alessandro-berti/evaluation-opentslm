Given the very limited nonzero segment and substantial artifact (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact), I cannot reliably delineate consistent P waves across the inferior leads or V1; the deflections visible early in the trace appear more consistent with noise or parts of the QRS rather than discrete, reproducible P waves. Classic right atrial enlargement should show tall, peaked P waves (P pulmonale) â‰¥2.5 mm in leads II/III/aVF and a prominent initial positive P component in V1 with normal P duration; neither feature can be demonstrated here, and where small presystolic deflections are suggested they are low amplitude and not consistently tall or narrow. The presence of a pacemaker (potentially with atrial pacing or fusion) further limits assessment of native P-wave morphology, and extra beats and artifacts compound this. Based on the available data, there is no convincing ECG evidence of right atrial overload/enlargement.
