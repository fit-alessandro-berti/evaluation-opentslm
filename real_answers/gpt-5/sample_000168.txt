Despite the marked baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker (which broadens QRS and makes ST/T interpretation unreliable), the brief analyzable segment shows a wide complex rhythm with disproportionately deep initial negative deflections and loss of R-wave amplitude in the inferior and lateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5–V6), consistent with a Q/QS pattern suggesting established infarction; in contrast, the anterior precordials (V1–V4) do not show a clear, isolated ST–T pattern of acute anterior ischemia that can be confidently separated from pacing-related repolarization changes and artifact, so anterior ischemia would be uncertain here, whereas the inferolateral Q-wave pattern is more specific. Final answer: myocardial infarction in inferolateral leads.
