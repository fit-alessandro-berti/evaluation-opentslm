Across the first ~120 ms, multiple leads (especially V4–V6) show abrupt, high‑amplitude, short‑duration spikes with rapid polarity changes between adjacent 10 ms samples (for example, swings up to ±6–7 units), and there is no gradual, low‑frequency wandering of the baseline over seconds; after 0.12 s the trace is essentially flat (zeros), precluding assessment of slow drift but reinforcing that the visible contamination is transient, high‑frequency artifact rather than a slow baseline shift. No consistent P–QRS–T morphology is discernible to suggest true cardiac activity during the noisy segment, which is characteristic of brief burst/electrode artifacts rather than baseline drift. Final answer: burst noise.
