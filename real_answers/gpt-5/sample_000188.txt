Inspecting lead V4 over the brief nonzero segment, the waveform shows abrupt, nonphysiologic sample-to-sample jumps and high-frequency fluctuations rather than organized P–QRS–T morphology: a single large, needle-like spike around 0.02 s consistent with a pacer artifact is followed by rapid irregular oscillations and small alternating deflections from roughly 0.03–0.11 s, features characteristic of broadband “snowy” interference rather than true cardiac activity; the subsequent complete signal dropout to zero is an additional artifact, but the early high-frequency, erratic baseline in V4 confirms static noise contamination. Final answer: Yes.
