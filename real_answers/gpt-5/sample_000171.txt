The 10-second recording is essentially absent after about 0.12 s, leaving only a single brief, noisy complex to review; within that initial 120 ms the limb and precordial leads show large, abrupt, multiphasic deflections with variable polarity and no consistent isoelectric baseline, making it impossible to reliably identify P waves, measure PR or QRS duration, or assess ST segments and T waves. The stated presence of a pacemaker further complicates ischemia interpretation because paced QRS complexes typically produce secondary, discordant STâ€“T changes, and any assessment would require multiple beats and clear ST-segment baselines across contiguous leads; none of this is available here due to marked baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, and apparent signal dropout. There are no sustained, reproducible ST-segment deviations in two contiguous leads, no hyperacute T waves, and no reciprocal changes that can be confidently discerned from this truncated, artifact-laden trace, and Sgarbossa-type criteria for paced rhythms cannot be applied. Final answer: No definitive evidence of early myocardial infarction is demonstrated on this ECG; the tracing is non-diagnostic and a repeat high-quality ECG with clinical correlation and serial high-sensitivity troponins is required.
