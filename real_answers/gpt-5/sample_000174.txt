Across the first captured beat, the QRS complex peaks around 0.04–0.05 s with tall R waves in the precordial leads, followed by the repolarization window (~0.07–0.11 s) where baseline drift and noise are present but the T-wave polarities remain consistent: the T wave is inverted in the precordial leads V1–V6 and in aVF and aVL, while it is paradoxically upright in aVR (which is abnormal), with upright T in I/II/III. In this context (and given the presence of a pacemaker and artifacts), these represent diffuse, non-localizing nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. Final answer: aVL, aVF, and V1–V6 (with an abnormally upright T in aVR as well).
