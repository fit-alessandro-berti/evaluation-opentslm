On inspection of the time series, there is only about 0.11 seconds of nonzero data followed by a complete flatline at zero across all 12 leads for the remaining ~9.9 seconds, which indicates severe technical failure or truncation of the recording; within the brief nonzero segment the deflections are large, nearly simultaneous across many leads (e.g., I and II are identical at several points), and do not display physiologic P waves, QRS complexes, or discernible intervals, which is more consistent with artifact than true cardiac activity; given the reported baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, and a pacemaker, no reliable assessment of rhythm, conduction (PR/QRS/QT), axis, or ischemic ST-T changes is possible, and pacemaker spikes/capture cannot be confirmed at this sampling and signal quality; although “extra beats” were detected by the device, they cannot be verified on this trace. Final answer: this ECG is non-diagnostic due to severe artifact and signal loss, so no abnormal symptoms can be determined from it; repeat the ECG with proper lead placement and filtering, and consider pacemaker interrogation.
