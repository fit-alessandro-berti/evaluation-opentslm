On review of the 12‑lead time series at 100 Hz, only the first ~120 ms contains nonzero signal and it is heavily contaminated by baseline drift, noise, and electrode artifact, with a pacemaker noted; there is no complete, clean P‑QRS‑T complex in any lead, and no discernible T‑wave termination from which to measure a QT. Paced rhythms further complicate QT assessment, and a JT alternative would still require an identifiable QRS and repolarization segment, which are not reliably present here. Because the tracing is truncated and distorted, the QT (and QTc) cannot be measured or interpreted from this recording. Final answer: indeterminate (cannot determine if the QT is above normal from this ECG).
