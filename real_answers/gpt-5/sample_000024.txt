Despite the significant noise and the very short segment of usable signal, the premature complex seen around 0.06–0.10 s has a relatively sharp, narrow QRS contour across multiple leads (e.g., tall, brisk R waves in V3–V6 without the broad, bizarre morphology or marked axis shift expected of a ventricular origin), and there is no clear preceding large pacing spike or grossly discordant ST‑T pattern that would suggest a paced or ventricular ectopic beat; these features are more consistent with a supraventricular ectopic conducted via the normal His–Purkinje system rather than a ventricular ectopic, which would be expected to be wide (>120 ms) and abnormal in morphology with a full compensatory pause. Final answer: supraventricular extrasystoles.
