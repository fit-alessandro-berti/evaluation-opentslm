The trace shows only a single complex over ~110 ms followed by prolonged signal dropout to 10 s, with marked baseline drift, burst/static noise, and clear paced-appearing, wide, high-amplitude, discordant QRS/ST-T morphology across multiple leads. In a ventricular-paced rhythm, secondary ST–T discordance obscures infarct patterns, and with this level of artifact and the absence of a stable isoelectric baseline or multiple beats, it’s not possible to reliably assess for hyperacute T waves, sustained ST-segment elevation/depression in a territorial pattern, or definitive pathologic Q waves of sufficient width and consistency to stage an infarction. Given the single noisy paced complex and lack of serial beats, any apparent ST deviations are uninterpretable and Sgarbossa-type assessment cannot be applied meaningfully. Final answer: Non-diagnostic/indeterminate stage (cannot determine infarction stage on this ECG due to paced rhythm and severe artifact).
