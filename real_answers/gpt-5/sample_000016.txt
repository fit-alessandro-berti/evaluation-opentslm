Only the first ~120 ms of this 10-second trace contains usable signal; the rest is flat (likely signal drop-out), and within that short window I can identify at most a single depolarization with a sharp positive deflection around 0.03 s across leads, without a clear preceding P wave or subsequent cycles to compare coupling intervals or look for a noncompensatory pause. There are marked artifacts (baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode disturbance), and although a pacemaker is noted, no consistent pacing spikes or paced complexes are discernible. Because supraventricular extrasystoles require demonstration of a premature, narrow QRS beat with an abnormal/early P wave and a characteristic pause relative to a baseline rhythm, and there is no sustained rhythm strip here to analyze, the findings do not support their presence on this recording segment. No.
