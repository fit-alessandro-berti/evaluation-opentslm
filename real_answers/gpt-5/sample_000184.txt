Inspecting lead aVR over the first ~110 ms shows rapid, sample-to-sample, high‑frequency oscillations with abrupt polarity changes and nonphysiologic morphology rather than a smooth P–QRS–T complex (e.g., −0.81 to +0.30 to +0.31 to −0.70 to +0.38 to −0.41 within successive 10 ms steps), culminating in a large, isolated positive spike around 0.09 s (≈2.13) immediately followed by a sharp negative swing. At a 100 Hz sampling rate, this irregular jitter and burst-like spiking are characteristic of static/electrical noise rather than true cardiac activity. Although other leads show similar global artifact and much of the subsequent record is flat (signal dropout), the presence of this noise is clearly evident within aVR. Final answer: Yes.
