The first 120 ms show a brief, narrow, highâ€‘amplitude, near-synchronous positive spike across essentially all leads (for example at 0.02 s and again around 0.09 s), which is characteristic of pacemaker artifacts rather than intrinsic myocardial depolarization; the subsequent deflections are low-resolution, short in duration, and appear broadly concordant across leads, suggesting that much of what we see is dominated by pacing and noise rather than true lead-specific QRS/ST-T morphology. With the stated baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, plus a pacemaker rhythm, reliable assessment for infarction patterns (territorial ST elevation/depression, reciprocal changes, pathologic Q waves) is not possible, and there is no convincing, lead-specific voltage pattern or strain configuration to support chamber hypertrophy either; the amplitudes provided do not allow application of standard LVH voltage criteria, and the globally similar waveforms argue against a valid morphological read. Final answer: neither (indeterminate due to pacemaker and artifacts).
