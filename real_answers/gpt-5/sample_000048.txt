The signal provided contains only a very brief nonzero segment (~0–0.11 s) followed by flatline zeros, and is further degraded by baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, which prevents reliable identification of multiple R peaks directly from the waveform and therefore precludes a precise RR measurement from the trace itself. Clinically, with a pacemaker one would expect a lower rate limit near 60–70 bpm (RR ~0.86–1.0 s) if pacing predominates; however, the recording explicitly notes extra beats during the tracing, which typically represent premature atrial or ventricular complexes with short coupling intervals that reduce the RR interval below the usual normal range (<600 ms). Thus, considering the presence of premature beats that shorten RR, the RR interval falls below the normal range.
