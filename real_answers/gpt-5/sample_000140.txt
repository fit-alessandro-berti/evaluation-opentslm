Reviewing the provided 10-second, 12-lead time series at 100 Hz, nearly the entire recording from about 0.12 s onward is flatlined at zero across all leads, leaving only the first ~120 ms with nonzero samples; this window captures what appears to be part of an initial depolarization event (likely a pacing spike and QRS activity, given the pacemaker and sharp excursions), but not the subsequent ST–T segment where the T wave would be expected (typically beginning >150–200 ms after QRS onset). With the T-wave portion essentially absent from the available data, and given the significant baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts reported, there is no reliable morphology in lead V4 that can be identified as a T wave for amplitude assessment. Therefore, there is no demonstrable evidence here to support the presence of a low-amplitude T wave in V4. Final answer: No.
