Despite substantial noise and pacemaker artifact, the dominant depolarization seen in the available limb-lead snapshot shows the main QRS deflection clearly positive in lead I and also positive in the inferior leads (II, aVF), with concordant positivity across the lateral precordials (V4–V6); this pattern places the frontal QRS axis between 0° and +90°, arguing against left-axis deviation (I positive with aVF negative) or right-axis deviation (I negative with aVF positive). Final answer: Normal axis (no deviation).
