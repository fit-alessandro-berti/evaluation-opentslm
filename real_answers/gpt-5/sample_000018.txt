Despite baseline drift, static/burst noise, and pacer-related secondary repolarization changes, the terminal repolarization portion appears blunted or shallowly discordant in the lateral distribution: the end of the QRS–T complex shows low‑amplitude, mildly negative or biphasic T morphology without contiguous ischemic pattern or sufficient depth to be diagnostic. This is most evident in the high lateral and lateral precordial leads, with subtle extension toward the mid‑lateral chest, while inferior and early anterior leads are less convincingly involved. Final answer: I, aVL, V5, V6 (with mild involvement of V4).
