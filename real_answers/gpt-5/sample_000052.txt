Despite the noisy, artifact-laden, and truncated recording, the limb-lead QRS polarities do not support a “northwest” (extreme) axis. Extreme axis deviation would require the net QRS to be predominantly negative in both lead I and aVF (often also negative in lead II), typically with aVR relatively positive. In the clearest, largest depolarization deflection seen here, the QRS is predominantly positive in lead I and also positive in aVF (and II/III), while aVR is not convincingly the sole positive limb lead; earlier negative swings appear non-sustained and likely reflect artifact or other phases of the complex rather than the net QRS vector. Even acknowledging pacing and noise that can alter morphology, there is no consistent pattern of simultaneous negativity in I and aVF to indicate an extreme axis. Final answer: No.
