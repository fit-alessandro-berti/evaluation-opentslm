The available tracings are extremely limited, with only the first ~120 ms showing signal and the remaining 9+ seconds flatlined, and the recording is further degraded by baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifacts; in addition, a pacemaker is present and “extra beats” were detected, all of which can obscure atrial activity. Right atrial enlargement is suggested on ECG by tall, peaked P waves in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) typically ≥2.5 mm and by a prominent initial positive P component in V1, with a normal P duration (<120 ms). In the brief, noisy segment that is visible, I cannot confidently identify consistent P waves across the inferior leads or in V1, and where small deflections are seen they do not form a reproducible tall, peaked P morphology; there is no clear evidence of a rightward P-wave axis, and P-wave amplitude criteria are not met or cannot be reliably measured. Given the poor signal quality and pacemaker confounding, atrial morphology cannot be assessed with diagnostic confidence, but there is no convincing “P pulmonale” pattern in the analyzable snippet. Final answer: No, there is no definite evidence of right atrial overload/enlargement on this ECG.
