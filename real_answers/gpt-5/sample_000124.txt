Inspecting lead III over the first 120 ms, the signal shows abrupt, nonphysiologic swings in amplitude from +0.63 to −0.94 and back within single 10 ms samples, without coherent P–QRS–T morphology and not time-locked to the complexes seen in other leads; this pattern is confined to a short window at the beginning of the trace and then disappears, with the remainder of the recording essentially flatlined to zero, which is inconsistent with the continuous high-frequency “fuzz” of static noise and more consistent with a brief, transient artifact. Final answer: burst noise.
