In lead aVL the tracing in the first ~0.11 s consists of nonphysiologic, large-amplitude, alternating polarity spikes that occur synchronously with other leads rather than in a P–QRS–T pattern, consistent with impulsive/burst artifact; immediately thereafter the signal becomes essentially flat at zero for the remainder of the record, suggesting an electrode/lead-off artifact or acquisition dropout. Within the brief nonzero segment there are rapid, irregular, high‑frequency fluctuations superimposed on small low‑frequency level shifts, which indicate static/high‑frequency noise and some baseline wander; no interpretable intervals or genuine cardiac morphology can be discerned in aVL because the tracing is dominated by artifact. Final answer: lead aVL shows baseline drift (wander), static/high-frequency noise, burst (impulsive) noise, and electrode artifacts (including lead-off/flatline).
