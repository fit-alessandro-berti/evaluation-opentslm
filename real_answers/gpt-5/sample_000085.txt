Despite significant noise and the very short usable segment (about 120 ms before the trace drops to zero), the dominant QRS morphology in the limb leads is clearly upright in I, II, III, and aVF with aVR negative, indicating the mean frontal QRS vector points inferiorly and leftward within the normal quadrant; lead II is strongly positive (argues against left axis deviation), and lead I is overall positive (argues against right axis deviation), so there is no evidence of extreme axis either. Final answer: Normal axis (no deviation).
