Despite the significant noise and artifacts, the initial 120 ms of signal shows a premature, broad and bizarre QRS morphology with marked concordant negativity across the precordial leads (V1â€“V6), without a clearly discernible preceding P wave in the limb leads, which is more in keeping with a ventricular origin than a supraventricular ectopic with aberrancy; I do not see definite pacemaker spikes immediately preceding the ectopic complex to suggest a paced beat, and although the recording truncates before we can confirm a full compensatory pause, the morphology strongly favors a ventricular premature complex. Final answer: ventricular extrasystoles.
