Across the 10 s, only the first ~110 ms contains nonzero data; thereafter every lead is flat at zero, which indicates data loss/lead disconnection rather than physiologic asystole. In that brief initial segment, all limb and precordial leads show nearly simultaneous, large-amplitude, rapidly changing deflections with concordant polarities (even aVR/aVL/aVF and V1–V6 moving together), a pattern that is not consistent with true cardiac activation but typical of electrode/motion artifact, burst noise, or amplifier saturation. No reproducible P waves, PR interval, QRS complexes of definable duration, ST segments, or T waves can be identified; the large negative excursion around 0.11 s is more compatible with artifact than with a genuine QRS or pacer spike, and there are no serial complexes to evaluate for paced morphology, ectopy, conduction blocks, or ischemic ST–T changes despite the metadata noting a pacemaker and extra beats. Final answer: The ECG is uninterpretable for form-related symptoms due to severe artifact and signal dropout; no reliable P–QRS–T morphology or pathologic form-related abnormalities can be concluded.
