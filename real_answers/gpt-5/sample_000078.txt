The initial complexes are broad and high-amplitude, consistent with a paced QRS, and the repolarization that follows shows the ST segment sitting below the baseline in several leads (notably lateral and inferior), with a horizontal to mildly downsloping contour typical of secondary ST-T changes from a paced rhythm; there is no clear, separate, symmetric terminal negative T wave across contiguous leads to support true T-wave inversion, and the apparent negative deflections occur early as part of the ST segment rather than as distinct T waves. Final answer: non-specific st depression.
