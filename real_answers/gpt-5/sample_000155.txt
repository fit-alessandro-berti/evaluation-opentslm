Across the 12 leads, only an initial ~120 ms segment contains nonzero signal, after which all leads are flatlined at zero for the remaining ~9.9 s, indicating substantial recording dropout and rendering rate and rhythm assessment impossible over the duration where rhythm would be established; within the brief active portion, there are abrupt, high-amplitude, narrow deflections that are synchronous across leads and more consistent with artifact and/or pacemaker spikes than organized cardiac depolarization, and no reproducible P-QRS-T morphology is discernible to measure PR, QRS, or QT or to identify atrial activity, AV conduction, or consistent ventricular activation; given the stated baseline wander, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, and the presence of a pacemaker, neither atrial arrhythmias nor ectopy can be confirmed or excluded from this trace, and pacemaker capture or sensing cannot be evaluated. Final answer: The recording is non-diagnostic for rhythm; no definitive rhythm-related abnormality can be confirmed on this ECG, and a repeat ECG with better signal quality (and pacemaker interrogation/telemetry) is recommended.
