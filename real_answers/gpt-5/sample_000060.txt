Despite considerable baseline drift, noise, and electrode artifacts, the dominant depolarization complexes across multiple leads (e.g., II, V1, V5/V6) are broad and multi-peaked, consistent with a paced or bundle-branch–block–like morphology; using the 100 Hz sampling, the earliest rapid deflection from baseline appears near 0.02 s and terminal return is not until roughly the end of the available nonzero window (~0.12 s), giving an estimated QRS width at least at the upper limit and likely exceeding 120 ms when accounting for terminal slurring and discordant terminal forces typical of ventricular pacing. Final answer: above the normal range.
