Lead V4 shows a sequence of mixed deflections with marked noise/artifact and a likely large, positive R (or paced) complex around 0.10 s, but the recording provides only about 120 ms of nonzero data in total, after which the trace is flat; because the T wave normally occurs 200–400 ms after the QRS, the ST–T segment in V4 is not captured here, so T‑wave polarity cannot be reliably assessed. The immediately post‑QRS samples remain positive and there is no clear, terminal negative deflection consistent with a T wave; with the significant baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker (which can also produce secondary repolarization changes), the morphology is further confounded. Therefore, there is no demonstrable evidence of an inverted T wave in V4 on this truncated, noisy segment. No.
