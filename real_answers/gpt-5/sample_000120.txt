Signal quality is very poor with marked artifact and only the first ~120 ms containing discernible activity, but focusing on the limb leads’ QRS polarity to infer the frontal plane axis: in the brief QRS-like complex, lead I is predominantly negative, which can point toward a rightward or superiorly directed axis; however, aVF is not predominantly positive—in fact, it is largely negative—so the classic right-axis pattern (negative I with positive aVF, +90 to +180 degrees) is not present. Lead II is not clearly positive either, which further argues against a typical rightward axis. Pacemaker presence and noise limit precision, but the available morphology does not support right axis deviation. Final answer: No.
