Across the first ~120 ms, the signal shows abrupt, nonphysiologic swings and identical values across several leads (e.g., I and II are exactly the same), which suggests shared-channel interference rather than true cardiac activity; immediately thereafter, all leads drop to absolute zero for the remaining ~9.9 s, indicating signal dropout/electrode detachment or a recording failure. Within the brief initial window there are high‑frequency transients consistent with burst/static interference, and the baseline fluctuates rather than remaining stable, implying baseline wander. No consistent P–QRS–T morphology is discernible and intervals cannot be assessed; pacemaker spikes, if present, cannot be reliably identified in this recording. Final answer: Yes—there is significant noise/artifact, including baseline drift, high‑frequency static/burst interference, and electrode artifact with prolonged signal dropout.
