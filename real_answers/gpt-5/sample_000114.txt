To assess frontal plane QRS axis, I look at the dominant QRS deflection in limb leads I and aVF (and corroborate with II/III) over the QRS window; in this trace, only a very brief segment contains nonzero data and it is heavily contaminated by baseline wander, noise, and electrode artifact, with a pacemaker present, all of which limit reliability. Within the available QRS-like deflections, aVF is predominantly negative, but lead I is not consistently positive; in fact, the largest excursions appear negative in both I and aVF, which would suggest an extreme axis rather than isolated left axis deviation, and in a paced rhythm the usual axis rules are not dependable. Given the absence of a clear pattern of positive QRS in lead I with negative in aVF, this tracing does not demonstrate left axis deviation. Final answer: No.
