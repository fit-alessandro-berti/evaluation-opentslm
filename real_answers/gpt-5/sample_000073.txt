Reviewing the first 120 ms of the tracing, there are brief, abrupt, high‑amplitude deflections occurring nearly simultaneously in most leads (for example large positive excursions around 0.08 s followed immediately by large negative swings around 0.09–0.11 s), without any coherent P–QRS–T morphology and inconsistent with physiologic activation or pacing artifacts; they appear as short, broadband, transient spikes across multiple channels, which is characteristic of burst noise (such as electrode pop or motion). The subsequent signal drop-out/flatline further suggests acquisition artifact rather than true cardiac activity. Yes.
