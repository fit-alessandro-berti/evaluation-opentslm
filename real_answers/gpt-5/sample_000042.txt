Reviewing lead aVL over the first 120 ms (the only nonzero segment), the trace shows a cluster of abrupt, high‑amplitude, alternating‑polarity deflections that occur within a very short window and do not form a physiologic P–QRS–T sequence: for example, aVL jumps from −0.305 at 0.05 s to +1.155 at 0.06 s, then to −0.096 at 0.07 s, −0.176 at 0.08 s, plunges to −1.310 at 0.09 s, then to −0.385 at 0.10 s and up to +0.667 at 0.11 s. These spiky, nonanatomic swings are simultaneous across multiple leads and are inconsistent with normal cardiac morphology or pacing artifacts, fitting the pattern of a brief burst of electrical noise/electrode artifact rather than a genuine QRS complex. Yes.
