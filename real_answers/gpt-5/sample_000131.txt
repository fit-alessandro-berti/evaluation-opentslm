Despite the very limited usable segment (only ~0–0.11 s before the trace goes flat) and significant artifact, the lateral precordial leads (V5–V6) show a prominent positive deflection consistent with the R wave followed immediately by a downsloping, “scooped” ST depression that dips below the baseline within tens of milliseconds after the peak; there is no clearly captured, separate T wave later in the cycle given the truncated recording, and the pattern looks like early post–J-point sagging rather than isolated T-wave inversion or flattening. This morphology—most evident in V5–V6 and not merely a terminal T-wave change—is characteristic of the digitalis (digoxin) effect and is more specific than a nonspecific T-wave abnormality, even acknowledging baseline drift, noise, extrasystoles, and the presence of a pacemaker. Final answer: digitalis effect.
