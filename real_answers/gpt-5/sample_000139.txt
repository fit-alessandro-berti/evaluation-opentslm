Inspecting lead aVF over the available 10 s, there is a single brief, simultaneous positive deflection across all leads at ~0.03 s consistent with a calibration/Artifact spike, followed by predominantly negative drift and then a prolonged isoelectric (near-zero) tracing without discernible P–QRS–T complexes. With no sustained cardiac cycles visible, intervals and ST–T morphology cannot be assessed, and any apparent deflections are more consistent with noise/artifact than true cardiac activity. Final answer: Uninterpretable/artefactual tracing in aVF (essentially flatline after a calibration-like spike); no reliable form-related abnormalities identifiable.
