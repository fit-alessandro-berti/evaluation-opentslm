The available time series is severely truncated after about 120 ms and is heavily contaminated by baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, with a pacemaker noted and extra beats reported, so there are no reliably measurable, repeated QRS complexes across multiple leads to apply standard LVH voltage criteria (e.g., Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell). In the brief visible segment, there is no consistent pattern of markedly increased QRS amplitudes across limb and precordial leads that would convincingly meet LVH thresholds even if scaling were dependable, and the presence of a paced rhythm typically produces secondary ST-T changes that render T-wave morphology non-specific. In this context, any T-wave abnormalities are most consistent with secondary, non-diagnostic repolarization changes related to pacing rather than primary ischemic or strain patterns. Final answer: non-diagnostic T abnormalities.
