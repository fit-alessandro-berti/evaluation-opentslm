Across the provided 10 seconds, only the first ~110 ms contain any nonzero data; this brief segment shows abrupt, high-amplitude deflections across multiple leads consistent with artifact rather than a clearly formed P–QRS–T complex, and thereafter the tracing is entirely flat (zeros), making beat-to-beat interpretation impossible. There are no discernible P waves, QRS morphologies, or pacing spikes to establish a baseline rhythm, no fixed coupling intervals, no compensatory pauses, and no ectopic-looking QRS complexes that would allow identification of premature atrial or ventricular beats. Given the severe noise, electrode artifact, and effective signal dropout, the tracing is not interpretable for ectopy. Final answer: No visible extra systoles can be identified on this ECG (inconclusive due to poor/absent signal).
