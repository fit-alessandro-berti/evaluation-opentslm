Despite the baseline drift, noise, and pacemaker, the limb-lead QRS polarity is sufficiently consistent to estimate the frontal axis: the QRS complexes in lead I are predominantly negative after the initial spike, and the QRS in aVF is also largely negative across the measurable window, with lead II similarly negative. A normal axis would show a predominantly positive QRS in leads I and II (often aVF as well), which is not the case here. The pattern of simultaneous negativity in I and aVF indicates a superior/rightward (extreme) axis, which can occur with ventricular pacing but is nonetheless not a normal frontal plane axis. Final answer: No, the axis is not normal.
