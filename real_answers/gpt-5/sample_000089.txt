Examining lead aVF over the brief nonzero segment (0.00–0.11 s at 100 Hz), the signal shows abrupt, rapid amplitude swings from about +1.08 to −1.46 to −1.53 to +0.97 to +1.47 and back negative within successive 10 ms samples, followed by a sudden dropout to zero, without any slow, smooth wandering of the isoelectric line over seconds. Such high-frequency, erratic jitter and step-like changes obscure any recognizable P–QRS–T morphology and are characteristic of high-frequency artifact rather than the low-frequency respiratory or motion-related undulation that defines baseline drift. Therefore, the noise present in lead aVF is static noise.
