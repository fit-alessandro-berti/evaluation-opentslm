The visible ECG segment contains only about 120 ms of nonzero data followed by flatline, which precludes assessment of RR intervals or identification of beat-to-beat prematurity; the brief nonzero portion shows a single large deflection with near-identical amplitudes across all leads (including aVR and chest leads), which is nonphysiologic and more consistent with artifact or a pacing-related/common-mode transient rather than a true QRS complex, and there are no clearly discernible premature P waves (that would suggest atrial extrasystoles), no isolated premature wide QRS complexes without preceding P waves (that would suggest ventricular extrasystoles), and no compensatory pauses or repetitive ectopic patterns; given the noisy acquisition and known pacemaker, a pacing spike or electrode artifact is the most plausible explanation for the observed deflection, and the recording as provided is too short and artifact-laden to document an ectopic beat. Final answer: No, this ECG does not show demonstrable extra systoles in the provided trace.
