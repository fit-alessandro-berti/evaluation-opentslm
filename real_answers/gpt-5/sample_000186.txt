The available 12‑lead trace is very short and of poor quality, with baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact, extra beats, and a ventricular pacemaker noted, and almost the entire 10‑second file is flat after ~0.12 s; only one paced ventricular complex is appreciably visible. In several leads (for example, II, V4–V6) a steep, wide negative deflection begins around 0.09–0.10 s (consistent with a paced QRS), followed by a large opposite‑polarity deflection around 0.11 s; the recording is truncated before repolarization clearly returns to the baseline, so a true QT interval cannot be measured and no RR interval is available to compute QTc. Nonetheless, there is no visual suggestion of a pathologically short ST‑T segment that would imply markedly abbreviated repolarization, and ventricular pacing typically widens depolarization and tends to lengthen the apparent QT rather than shorten it. Given these constraints, the findings argue against a short QT; the QTc falls within the normal range.
