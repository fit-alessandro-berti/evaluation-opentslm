Across the first 0.12 s of this 10 s, 100 Hz recording, there is a single sharp deflection consistent with a paced QRS complex (most conspicuous in V1 around 0.07 s) amid baseline drift and noise; from 0.12 s onward, all leads are flat zeros, strongly suggesting signal dropout rather than sustained asystole. Because there is only one identifiable QRS complex and no subsequent native or paced beats captured, no consecutive RR intervals can be measured, and thus the sinus cycle length cannot be compared to the adult normal range (about 600–1000 ms). Final answer: Indeterminate — the RR interval cannot be assessed from this trace.
