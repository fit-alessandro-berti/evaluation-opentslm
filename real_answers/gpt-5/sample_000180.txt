The recording is dominated by noise, dropout, and electrode artifact, with only a very brief initial segment (~0–0.12 s) showing any discernible signal and then extensive flatline, which makes assessment of the repolarization phase challenging; within the available window there is no clear, consistent ST–T segment following a QRS complex, and across leads the deflections that could correspond to T-waves are either absent or extremely small and indistinct, without reproducible features of inversion, biphasic morphology, or exaggerated/hyperacute shapes that would support a specific qualitative T-wave abnormality. Given the lack of a well-formed T morphology and the uniformly tiny or non-discernible repolarization deflection in the context of heavy artifact (and possible pacemaker interference), the pattern is more consistent with flattened/low-amplitude T-waves rather than a defined T-wave abnormality. Final answer: low amplitude t-wave.
