Across the 10-second time series there are essentially no interpretable cardiac complexes: after roughly 0.11 seconds, all leads are flatlined at zero, and the brief initial segment shows large, simultaneous polarity swings across all leads that are characteristic of electrode/burst noise rather than true P–QRS–T morphology; with this level of artifact (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts) and a pacemaker in situ, there are no clearly discernible QRS complexes to assess for premature, wide, bizarre morphologies, fixed coupling intervals, fusion/capture beats, or compensatory pauses that would support ventricular extrasystoles. On this trace, ventricular extrasystoles are not demonstrable. Final answer: No.
