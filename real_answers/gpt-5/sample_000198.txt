The brief analyzable segment shows narrow-appearing QRS complexes without a consistent qR pattern in the inferior leads (III, aVF) and without the classic rS pattern in I/aVL that would indicate left posterior fascicular block; instead, lead I is largely negative while lead III is not clearly qR, arguing against a true LPFB axis pattern. In the anteroseptal precordial leads, the post‑QRS segment appears depressed below the isoelectric line in V1–V2 (and near isoelectric to slightly depressed in V3), compatible with horizontal/downsloping ST depression consistent with subendocardial injury, while V4 trends toward baseline or slight elevation, a distribution fitting an anteroseptal subendocardial process. Although the recording is noisy and a pacemaker is present, the limb-lead morphology does not meet criteria for LPFB, whereas the precordial ST-segment changes point toward ischemic subendocardial injury. Final answer: subendocardial injury in anteroseptal leads.
