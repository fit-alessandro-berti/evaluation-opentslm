I reviewed the provided 12‑lead signal segment and tried to identify a complete QRS–T complex to measure QT from the onset of the QRS to the end of the T wave in a lead with a clear terminal T (typically II, V5, or V6). The trace shows a large, sharp deflection around 0.06 s consistent with a QRS, followed by brief low‑amplitude deflections up to about 0.11 s, after which the recording becomes entirely flat (zeros) for the remainder of the 10‑second window. With baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and a pacemaker noted, precise delineation of T‑wave end is already challenging; moreover, the available data do not include a full repolarization period beyond ~0.12 s, making any QT estimate physiologically implausible and technically invalid. Therefore, the QT interval cannot be reliably determined from this recording. Final answer: Indeterminate/unmeasurable from the provided signal.
