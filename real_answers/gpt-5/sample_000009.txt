On inspection of the 10-second, 12‑lead signal, only the first ~120 ms contains nonzero data and thereafter all leads are flat at zero, indicating major data dropout; within that brief initial window the deflections are nearly identical in timing and amplitude across all 12 leads, culminating in a large simultaneous negative pulse (~−1.1 mV at ~0.11 s), a pattern far more consistent with a calibration pulse or global/electrode artifact than with true cardiac depolarization. No reproducible P–QRS–T sequences are present, so heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QTc, axis, ST segments, and T waves cannot be measured, and rhythm determination is not possible; there are no confirmable pacemaker spikes with capture, and the reported “extra beats” cannot be corroborated. Given the stated baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, the tracing is technically non-diagnostic/uninterpretable. Uncertain findings include the possibility of pacing artifacts and a paced ventricular complex with secondary ST‑T changes, as well as possible ectopy, but these cannot be confirmed; no definitive evidence of ischemia, infarction, or conduction block can be established or excluded from this recording. Final answer: technically inadequate, non-diagnostic ECG; no definitive abnormalities can be diagnosed; uncertain/possible pacing activity and ectopy, with all other abnormalities indeterminate.
