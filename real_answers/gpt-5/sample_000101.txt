Given the noisy baseline and pacer-related artifacts, I focused on the clearest QRS morphology in leads II, V2, and V5, estimating onset at the first rapid deflection and offset when the signal returns toward the isoelectric line. At 100 Hz (10 ms per sample), the main ventricular complex spans roughly 8–10 samples across these leads (for example, in lead II from about 0.02–0.10 s and in V2 from about 0.02–0.11 s), yielding an approximate duration of 80–100 ms. Even accounting for noise and the pacer spike immediately preceding depolarization, the QRS width consistently remains below 120 ms. Final answer: 80–120 ms.
