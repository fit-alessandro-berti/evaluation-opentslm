Reviewing the provided 12‑lead signal, there is only a brief 120 ms segment with large, nonphysiologic, in‑phase deflections across multiple leads followed by complete signal dropout (all leads at zero) for the remainder of the 10‑second recording, which prevents assessment of consecutive cardiac cycles. Within the brief segment available, there are no clearly discernible P waves, QRS complexes, PR intervals, or RR intervals to establish timing or identify a premature narrow complex with or without a preceding ectopic P wave, and no post‑extrasystolic pause can be assessed. The observed sharp deflections are more consistent with artifact (and could reflect pacing or electrode noise) rather than true supraventricular activity. Given the heavy artifact, pacemaker presence, and lack of analyzable beats, there is no demonstrable evidence of supraventricular extrasystoles on this trace. Final answer: No.
