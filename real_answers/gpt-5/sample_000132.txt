Across the first ~120 ms the tracings show a few erratic, large-amplitude deflections that are not morphologically consistent with true P–QRS–T complexes and vary incongruently across leads, followed by an isoelectric line at exactly zero in all 12 leads for the remaining ~9.9 seconds, which strongly indicates signal loss/lead-off or recording failure rather than physiological asystole. Because of pervasive baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact, no reliable P waves, QRS complexes, RR regularity, or pacemaker spikes/capture can be identified, and intervals cannot be measured; any “extra beats” cannot be verified on this extract, and pacemaker function cannot be assessed. Final answer: this ECG is non-diagnostic for rhythm due to severe artifact and near-complete signal loss, so no rhythm-related symptoms can be determined from this recording.
