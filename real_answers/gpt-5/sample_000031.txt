Across all 12 leads, the tracings in the first 120 ms show abrupt, simultaneous deflections that do not form physiologic P–QRS–T complexes (for example the large synchronous negative deflection around 0.04 s), and then the recording devolves into prolonged complete signal dropout with flatline at zero from ~0.12 s onward, which is incompatible with continuous cardiac activity and indicates electrode/lead-off artifact or acquisition failure rather than true asystole. The initial segment also has small irregular high‑frequency jitter suggestive of static noise and minor baseline instability that could reflect baseline wander, and the abrupt, nonphysiologic transients are consistent with burst noise or electrode pops; no reliable intervals or morphology can be measured, and any pacemaker activity is not assessable in this corrupted signal. Final answer: Yes—this ECG is contaminated by multiple noises, including baseline drift, high-frequency/static noise, transient burst artifacts, and electrode/lead-off artifacts, resulting in poor signal quality.
