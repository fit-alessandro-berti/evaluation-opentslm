Across essentially all 12 leads in the first ~0.01–0.11 s there are abrupt, synchronous, high‑amplitude deflections with rapid polarity swings that are nonphysiologic and do not conform to recognizable P–QRS–T morphology or intervals; this cluster is immediately followed by complete signal dropout with all leads at zero, which is typical of transient recording artifact rather than true cardiac electrical activity. The simultaneity across leads, erratic amplitudes, and very short duration of this segment are characteristic of a brief burst of broadband noise or an electrode pop, not pacemaker spikes or normal complexes. Yes.
