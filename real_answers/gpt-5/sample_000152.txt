Across the first ~120 ms there are abrupt, nonphysiologic, step-like deflections that occur simultaneously in every lead, and then the tracing becomes a complete flatline at exactly 0.00 in all 12 leads for the remaining ~9.9 s; there are no discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves to measure, and the uniform, abrupt loss of signal across all channels is far more consistent with a lead-off or electrode/cable failure than with true cardiac asystole. Classic “static” or mains noise would appear as a continuous high-frequency or sinusoidal 50/60 Hz contamination superimposed on the ECG baseline, not as an identical, simultaneous zeroing of all leads; the synchronous baseline jumps and subsequent complete signal drop strongly indicate electrode artifact rather than static interference. Final answer: electrodes problems.
