Given the 100 Hz sampling (10 ms per sample) and the noisy, artifact-laden trace with a pacemaker, I focused on leads II and V1 where atrial activity is usually most discernible. In lead II there is a small, rounded deflection centered near 0.08 s with onset and return to baseline spanning roughly 3–5 samples (about 30–50 ms), and V1 shows a similarly brief, low-amplitude biphasic atrial deflection over a comparable width; the larger, sharper excursions occurring around 0.02–0.04 s are too abrupt to represent a P wave and are more consistent with paced/ventricular activity or artifact. Even accounting for baseline drift and noise, the atrial deflection across multiple leads is clearly shorter than the expected adult P-wave duration (typically ~80–110 ms, upper limit 120 ms). Therefore, the P duration falls below the normal range.
