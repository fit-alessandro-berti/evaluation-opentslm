In the brief segment of lead I that is actually populated (about the first 120 ms) the signal shows baseline wander and noise but a clearly dominant, steeply rising positive deflection peaking around 1.5 mV without a convincing initial Q or terminal S, i.e., a monophasic R-wave morphology; the trace then truncates to zero so P waves, ST segment and T wave cannot be assessed, and no pacemaker spike is clearly resolved in this window. Final answer: Lead I demonstrates a tall, monophasic R wave (dominant positive QRS) without a pathologic Q or terminal S; STâ€“T assessment not possible due to artifact/limited data.
