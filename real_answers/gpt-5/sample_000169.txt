Inspecting the first 110 ms, the tracings show abrupt, nonphysiologic step-like amplitude changes and synchronous high-frequency fluctuations that do not form coherent P–QRS–T complexes; several samples even share identical values across channels (for example around 0.07–0.11 s), which is characteristic of system-wide static/interference rather than true cardiac activity. This contamination appears concurrently in both limb and precordial leads, and the remainder of the segment is flatlined (zeros), precluding reliable interval or morphology assessment and further supporting that the perturbations represent noise rather than beat-related activity. Final answer: static noise is present in all 12 leads—leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1 through V6.
