Inspecting lead V3 over the available segment, the waveform shows abrupt, nonphysiologic sample-to-sample excursions (for example, jumping from 0.65 to −1.52 around 0.02–0.03 s, after a 1.79 peak at 0.01 s) that are far too rapid and large to represent true cardiac morphology at 100 Hz, consistent with high-frequency static/burst artifact rather than a normal P–QRS–T sequence; moreover, the entire lead then drops to a flat zero from 0.12 s onward, which is a clear sign of electrode/lead disconnection or severe recording artifact rather than asystole. These features indicate contamination of V3 by noise and electrode artifacts. Final answer: Yes.
