Across the first ~120 ms of the recording, all channels show abrupt, high‑amplitude, rapidly alternating deflections without organized P–QRS–T morphology (for example, large synchronous swings at 0.02–0.05 s with peaks up to ~2–2.5 units in multiple leads), followed by complete signal dropout (flat zero thereafter). The simultaneous, nonphysiologic transients in both limb and precordial leads are characteristic of a brief burst of artifact (burst noise), rather than true cardiac activity or isolated pacemaker spikes. Final answer: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.
