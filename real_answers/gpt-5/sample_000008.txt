Despite baseline drift, noise and the presence of a pacemaker, the brief analyzable segment shows marked, sustained elevation above the baseline in the anterior–lateral precordial leads (V3–V6) with very large, broad, positive deflections consistent with hyperacute ST–T morphology rather than isolated T-wave inversion; there is no clear development of pathologic Q waves or symmetric deep T-wave inversions that would indicate an evolving/subacute or resolving phase, and the pattern does not fit a remote infarct with old Q waves and near-isoelectric ST segments. These findings are most consistent with the acute injury phase (hyperacute/early STEMI).
