On inspection of the raw time series, only the first ~120 ms contain nonzero data; thereafter the tracing is flat (all leads at 0), which strongly suggests recording dropout or lead-off rather than true asystole. Within the brief nonzero segment, there are abrupt, near-synchronous swings across essentially all leads (for example, large uniform negative deflections around 0.06 s and alternating high-amplitude deflections at 0.03–0.07 s) that are characteristic of artifact rather than organized cardiac depolarization; baseline drift and burst/static noise are evident, and true P–QRS–T morphology cannot be delineated at the 100 Hz resolution. Pacemaker spikes are not clearly resolvable at this sampling rate, and capture cannot be confirmed from morphology; however, the presence of a pacemaker is noted clinically. Because of noise and dropout, rhythm diagnosis (including atrial activity and ST–T analysis) is not reliable, though the recording flags extra beats. Final answer: Paced rhythm present; ectopic beats present but indeterminate type; marked artifact with baseline wander, static/burst noise, and electrode-related disturbances; prolonged signal dropout mimicking asystole. Uncertain symptoms: possible intermittent pacemaker sensing/capture issues versus artifact; premature beats likely PVCs or PACs (type indeterminate); atrial arrhythmia (e.g., AF/flutter) and ischemic ST–T changes cannot be assessed/excluded due to poor signal quality.
