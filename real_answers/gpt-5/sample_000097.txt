The trace shows low-frequency wandering of the isoelectric line rather than stable baselines, with a progressive negative shift over the first 100–120 ms that is synchronous across channels (for example, limb leads II and III drift from mildly negative values to roughly −1 mV by 0.11 s, and precordials such as V1–V6 show a similar sag), punctuated by simultaneous multilead excursions (e.g., the large deflection around 0.04–0.05 s) consistent with electrode motion and baseline wander rather than physiologic ST/T changes; this pattern is global rather than confined to a subset of leads. Final answer: baseline drift is present in all 12 leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1–V6).
