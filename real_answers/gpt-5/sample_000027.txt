Despite noise and artifacts, the early portion of the tracing shows in V1 a characteristic rSR′-type morphology with two small positive deflections around 0.03 s and 0.06 s separated by a brief negative dip, and the overall QRS duration, estimated from initial deflection (~0.02 s) to return to baseline (~0.08–0.09 s), appears well under 120 ms; lateral leads (I, V6) do not display the broad, notched, monophasic R waves with absent q waves typical of left bundle branch block, nor is there a uniformly negative QS in V1 that would support LBBB. These features favor a right bundle branch conduction pattern that is not fully widened, consistent with incomplete right bundle branch block. Final answer: incomplete right bundle branch block.
