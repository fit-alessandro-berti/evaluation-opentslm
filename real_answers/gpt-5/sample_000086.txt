The visible portion of the tracing (first ~120 ms) shows abrupt, high‑frequency, nonphysiologic fluctuations with large, rapid polarity reversals and spikes across multiple leads, without discernible P–QRS–T morphology; thereafter the signal drops to a flatline (likely lead-off/data dropout). This pattern reflects jagged, transient interference rather than a smooth, low‑frequency wander of the isoelectric line that would evolve over seconds with respiration or patient movement. There is no gradual baseline shift; instead, the brief segment is dominated by high‑frequency artifact consistent with static interference. Final answer: static noise.
