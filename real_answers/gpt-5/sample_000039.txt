Inspecting the brief, noisy V2 tracing, the deflection sequence around the apparent QRS shows an initial small negative deflection (q) followed by a low-amplitude positive deflection (R ≈ 0.3–0.4 mV) and then a comparatively deeper negative deflection (S ≈ −1.0 mV), i.e., a complex dominated by S with only a small R. Baseline wander and burst/electrode noise limit confident assessment of ST-T, and the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats further complicate interpretation, but the core QRS morphology in V2 appears to be one with a low R and prominent S, suggesting poor R-wave progression rather than a robust anterior R wave. Final answer: Lead V2 shows an rS-type QRS with a small R and deep, dominant S (poor R-wave progression) and an initial q; ST-T assessment is unreliable due to artifact.
