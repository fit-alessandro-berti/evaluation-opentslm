Despite the significant baseline drift and noise, a small, rounded atrial deflection can be identified best in lead II before the larger, steeper complex that begins around 0.07 s (likely a paced/QRS-related event). In lead II, the atrial deflection rises from near baseline at approximately 0.00 s, peaks by ~0.02 s, and returns to baseline by about 0.06–0.07 s; a similar brief, low‑amplitude deflection is seen in V1. With a 100 Hz sampling rate (10 ms per sample), this spans roughly 5–7 samples, i.e., about 50–70 ms; even allowing for noise and a generous boundary, the P wave width remains clearly below 120 ms, and there is no consistent notching or extended atrial activity that would push duration beyond the normal threshold. Therefore, the P duration falls within the normal range.
