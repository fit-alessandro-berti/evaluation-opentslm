Given the heavy artifact and pacemaker presence, the clearest atrial activity is a low‑amplitude deflection best appreciated in lead II and the lateral precordials just before the recording drops to zero, where a small positive wave spans roughly from about 0.07 s and returns to baseline by around 0.10–0.11 s; across the available leads this corresponds to a typical, normal-length P wave rather than a prolonged one, despite baseline drift and noise. Final answer: 80–110 ms (0.08–0.11 s).
