The available 10-second recording is almost entirely flatlined at zero from 0.12 s onward, with only a brief, noisy deflection complex between 0.00 and 0.11 s; given the pronounced baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifact, as well as the presence of a pacemaker, there is insufficient continuous rhythm to evaluate P-wave morphology, coupling intervals, or pauses. I do not see a series of beats from which to identify premature narrow QRS complexes preceded by abnormal P waves with a non-compensatory pause (typical of premature atrial beats) or premature junctional beats. Despite the metadata noting “extra beats detected,” the visible time series does not display analyzable premature supraventricular complexes, nor are non-compensatory pauses discernible. Therefore, based on the provided signal, there is no demonstrable evidence of supraventricular extrasystoles. Final answer: No.
