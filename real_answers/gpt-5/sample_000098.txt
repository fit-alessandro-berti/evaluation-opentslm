Despite the heavy noise and the very brief segment of analyzable signal, the captured beat shows an abrupt, very narrow initial deflection simultaneously in multiple leads consistent with a pacing artifact, immediately followed by a relatively wide ventricular complex with discordant polarities across leadsâ€”features typical of ventricular capture from a pacemaker rather than the narrow, rapid, regular QRS complexes expected in supraventricular tachycardia; moreover, there is no sustained rapid rhythm visible in the 10-second window to support SVT, and the metadata confirms a pacemaker is present. Final answer: normal functioning artificial pacemaker.
