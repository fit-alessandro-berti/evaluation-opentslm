In lead II, the brief nonzero segment shows abrupt, jagged, high‑frequency fluctuations with rapid sample-to-sample swings (e.g., from negative to sharply positive within 10–20 ms) and no stable P–QRS–T morphology, followed by a long flat dropout; this pattern reflects high-frequency interference rather than a smooth, low-frequency wandering of the isoelectric line that would characterize respiratory or motion-related baseline drift. Final answer: static noise.
