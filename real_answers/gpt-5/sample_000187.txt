The trace shows substantial artifact and a very truncated recording: after roughly 120 ms nearly the entire 10 s segment is flatlined at zero, so there is no sustained rhythm to evaluate. Within the brief nonzero portion, there are abrupt deflections across multiple leads with marked baseline drift and burst/static noise, which could reflect either a single QRS complex or artifact; there is no reliable isoelectric baseline or contiguous ST segment on which to judge ST elevation/depression, and T-wave morphology cannot be assessed. Given the documented presence of a pacemaker and the lack of analyzable ST/T data, the finding most consistent with what can be inferred (and what a pacemaker implies) is a conduction disturbance. Final answer: conduction disturbance.
