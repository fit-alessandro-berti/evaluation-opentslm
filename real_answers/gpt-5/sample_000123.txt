Focusing on the limb lead I tracing, the brief segment of available signal shows a single, high-amplitude, predominantly negative ventricular complex with little to no initial positive deflection, consistent with a deep S or even QS morphology; P and T waves are not reliably discernible given the heavy artifact, baseline instability, and truncation of the recording, and the broad, large-amplitude negative deflection could also be compatible with a paced, wide QRS manifesting as a discordant, predominantly negative polarity in lead I. Final answer: lead I demonstrates a predominantly negative QRS with a deep S/QS morphology.
