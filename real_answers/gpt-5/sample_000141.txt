Inspecting lead V1 over the available 0.00–0.11 s, the signal shows abrupt, large-amplitude, rapidly alternating deflections (e.g., 4.50 → 3.67 → −2.00 → −4.31 → 4.14 mV-equivalent) with steep slopes every 10 ms, without any discernible physiologic P–QRS–T morphology, and then the trace effectively ceases (zeros thereafter). This short-lived, high-amplitude, spiky interference confined to a brief interval is characteristic of a transient artifact rather than the persistent, low-amplitude, high-frequency “fuzz” that would be expected from static noise extending across the recording. Final answer: burst noise.
