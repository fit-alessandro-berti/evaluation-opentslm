In lead aVF, the first 120 ms consist of abrupt, large, nonphysiologic swings that do not form a recognizable P–QRS–T complex and flip rapidly from positive to negative, which is typical of high‑frequency “static” noise with superimposed brief spike-like transients consistent with burst noise; immediately thereafter (from 0.12 s through the end of the record) the trace is completely flat at zero, indicating signal drop‑out from electrode/lead‑off artifact rather than true asystole, and within the brief initial segment there is also low‑frequency baseline instability suggestive of baseline wander. Final answer: baseline drift (wander), high‑frequency/static noise, burst/spike noise, and electrode/lead‑off artifact with signal drop‑out.
