Despite the significant baseline drift, noise, and pacemaker artifact, the brief segment with measurable signal shows the most convincing ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads rather than the lateral limb leads: at approximately 0.11 s the anterior/septal precordials (V1–V4) display a clear positive offset above the preceding isoelectric segment with a progressive increase across the chest leads, while the lateral limb leads (I, aVL) do not show concordant elevation and are instead negative or near baseline, with no consistent lateral ST elevation pattern; this distribution favors an anterior–septal territory injury pattern over a purely lateral one. Final answer: myocardial infarction in anteroseptal leads.
