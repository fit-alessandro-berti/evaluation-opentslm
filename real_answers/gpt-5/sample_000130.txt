In lead II, the first 120 ms show abrupt, nonphysiologic sample-to-sample jumps and short, sharp spikes without discernible P–QRS–T morphology, which indicates high-frequency contamination rather than true cardiac activity; at ~0.02 s the limb leads momentarily share identical values, consistent with a digital or impulsive artifact burst, and from ~0.12 s onward the trace becomes perfectly flat at zero for the rest of the recording, which is classic for electrode motion/lead-off or channel dropout rather than asystole. Because of these artifacts, intervals and rhythm cannot be reliably assessed in lead II, and any slow isoelectric shifts in the very brief initial segment are overshadowed by the larger artifacts but are compatible with baseline wander. Final answer: lead II demonstrates baseline wander, high-frequency “static” noise, burst/impulsive noise, and electrode motion/lead-off artifact with channel dropout.
