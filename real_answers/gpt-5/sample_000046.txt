To determine the frontal plane axis, I focus on the predominant QRS polarity in the limb leads; despite substantial baseline drift, burst/static noise, electrode artifact, and pacing spikes saturating all channels around 0.09–0.11 s, the brief analyzable segments show QRS complexes that are overall upright in lead I while being predominantly negative in the inferior leads (aVF and II), with lead III tending negative as well and aVR relatively less negative/occasionally positive—an orientation that points the mean QRS vector leftward and superior rather than toward the right or inferior quadrants; this pattern, which also fits a paced RV apical morphology tendency, supports a leftward deviation rather than normal, rightward, or extreme axis. Final answer: Left axis deviation.
