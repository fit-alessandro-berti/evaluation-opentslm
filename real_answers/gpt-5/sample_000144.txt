The provided 12‑lead signal shows only about 120 ms of nonzero data followed by a flat line at zero for the remaining ~9.9 seconds, which indicates truncation/artifact rather than true asystole; within the brief initial segment there appears to be a single depolarization with a likely R peak around 0.06 s and early repolarization, but the T wave is not captured and there is no complete cardiac cycle from which to identify the end of the T wave or calculate a QT or QTc, nor is there an RR interval to use for rate correction. Given the stated poor signal quality (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts), extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker (which further complicates QT assessment because paced QRS complexes widen and standard QT measurements are unreliable; JT/JTc are preferred), this tracing is not suitable for reliable interval measurement. Final answer: indeterminate—QT interval cannot be assessed on this ECG, so whether it is within the normal range cannot be determined.
