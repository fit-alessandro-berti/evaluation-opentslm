Despite significant artifact and the presence of ventricular pacing (both of which limit ST–T interpretation), the segment between the end of the QRS and the onset of the T wave shows a downward shift from the isoelectric baseline in several territories. Around the putative J-point/early ST window (approximately 60–80 ms after depolarization in this trace), the lateral leads show a shallow, horizontal-to-downsloping ST segment below the baseline, and a similar mild depression is seen in the inferior limb leads; these changes are not accompanied by reciprocal contiguous ST elevation, and the anterior septal leads do not demonstrate convincing depression, making the pattern most consistent with nonspecific ST depression in the inferolateral distribution. Final answer: I, II, III, aVL, aVF, V5, and V6.
