The available ECG time series is almost entirely flat after 0.12 s, with only a very brief fragment at the start showing sharp, synchronous deflections across leads that occur too closely together to represent physiologic cardiac cycles and are more consistent with artifact or pacemaker-related activity in the context of baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifact. There are no clearly identifiable P waves with altered morphology preceding premature, narrow QRS complexes, and no convincing noncompensatory pausesâ€”features that would support supraventricular extrasystoles. Given the severe signal limitations and pacemaker presence, no definitive supraventricular premature beats can be identified. Final answer: No.
