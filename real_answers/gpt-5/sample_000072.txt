The tracing shows only an initial ~120 ms of nonzero signal followed by complete signal dropout (flatline) across all leads for the remainder of the 10-second recording, making rate, rhythm, PR, QT, and ST–T assessment impossible. In the brief captured segment, the precordial leads (especially V2–V4) display abrupt, high-amplitude, discordant biphasic deflections without clearly discernible P waves and with morphology suggestive of a wide QRS, features that could reflect a ventricularly paced complex or substantial artifact; at a 100 Hz sampling rate, pacing spikes would not be expected to be reliably visible. Combined with the reported baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats, and the presence of a pacemaker, the study lacks normal sinus morphology and is not interpretable as physiologically normal. Final answer: No, this is not a normal ECG.
