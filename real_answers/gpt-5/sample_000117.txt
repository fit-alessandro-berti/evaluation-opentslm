Across the first ~120 ms the tracings in multiple leads, especially the precordials, show abrupt, high‑amplitude, nonphysiologic excursions with rapid polarity changes and no discernible P–QRS–T morphology, followed by a sudden transition to a flat signal for the remainder of the recording; this pattern is impulsive and short‑lived rather than a slow, low‑frequency wandering of the isoelectric line that would evolve over seconds. The absence of gradual baseline shifts and the presence of brief, synchronous spikes across leads indicate a transient artifact rather than respiratory or movement‑related baseline wander. Therefore, the noise present is burst noise.
