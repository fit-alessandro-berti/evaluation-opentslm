On inspection of the raw time series, only the first ~120 ms contain nonzero values and these show large, near-synchronous deflections across multiple leads with inconsistent morphology, which is far more compatible with saturation/electrode artifact or burst noise than with physiologic P–QRS–T complexes; thereafter, all leads are identically flat at zero for the remaining ~9.9 s, which strongly suggests recording dropout or lead disconnection rather than true asystole (as true asystole would not present as identical zeros across all channels). Because there is no continuous, interpretable atrial activity, QRS morphology, or P–QRS–T sequence to measure intervals or regularity, heart rate, rhythm regularity, AV association, ectopy, or paced complexes cannot be evaluated; pacing spikes are not discernible and, at this sampling rate with the level of noise, capture/sensing cannot be assessed. In this context of documented baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artifacts, the tracing is non-diagnostic for rhythm, and any determination of arrhythmia (AF, flutter, AV block, VT/VF, pauses/asystole, or pacemaker-related rhythms) cannot be made from this dataset; repeat a high-quality 12-lead and review device interrogation/telemetry to assess rhythm. Final answer: Uninterpretable for rhythm; no reliable rhythm-related conclusion can be drawn from this ECG.
