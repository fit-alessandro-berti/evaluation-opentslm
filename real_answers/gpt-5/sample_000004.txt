The first ~120 ms of this tracing shows inconsistent, abrupt deflections across leads with baseline instability that look like artifact rather than organized cardiac depolarization, and from 0.12 s through the remainder of the 10-second recording all 12 leads are exactly flat at zero, which strongly suggests recording failure/lead disconnection or data dropout rather than true asystole. Because there are no repeatable P–QRS–T complexes, intervals (PR, QRS, QTc), axis, ST segments, T waves, or rhythm can’t be assessed, and pacemaker spikes or capture cannot be evaluated at this sampling rate and signal quality. The provided note about extra beats cannot be corroborated on the visible signal. Final answer: This ECG is uninterpretable/non-diagnostic due to severe artifact and likely lead-off/data loss, so no reliable abnormalities can be determined; repeat the ECG with proper electrode contact and pacemaker system check.
