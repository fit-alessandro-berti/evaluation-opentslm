On inspection of the 12-lead time series, only the first ~120 ms contains nonzero data, after which the tracing is flat to the end of the 10-second window, indicating profound dropout or saturation; within that brief segment there are large, abrupt, multiphasic deflections across most leads with no clearly discernible P wave, QRS onset/offset, ST segment, or T wave, and the pattern is dominated by burst/static noise and electrode artifact, consistent with the reported poor signal quality and the presence of a pacemaker and extra beats; as a result there is no reliable repeating RR interval to derive heart rate, no measurable PR interval, no defensible QRS duration boundary, and no QT/QTc or electrical axes that can be computed, and any apparent narrow deflection could just as easily reflect artifact or pacing activity rather than physiological conduction. Final answer: No numeric ECG features can be confidently stated to fall within the normal range from this recording.
