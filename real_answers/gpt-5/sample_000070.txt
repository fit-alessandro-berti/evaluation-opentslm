Despite the noise and the presence of a pacemaker, the limb-lead QRS morphology and axis are the most reliable features here: the QRS appears relatively narrow, with a leftward/superior frontal plane axis pattern characterized by predominant positivity in lead I and aVL with relative negativity in the inferior leads, compatible with a qR in I/aVL and rS in II/III/aVF, which is typical of a left anterior fascicular block; by contrast, convincing, concordant ST-segment deviations or T-wave changes in the inferior (II, III, aVF) and lateral (I, aVL, V5â€“V6) leads that would firmly indicate inferolateral ischemia are not consistently demonstrable and would be uninterpretable in a paced rhythm and with the level of artifact present. Final answer: left anterior fascicular block.
