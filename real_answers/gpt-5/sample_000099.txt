Across the first ~120 ms, the tracings show abrupt, high-frequency, nonphysiologic deflections with alternating polarity and large sample-to-sample amplitude swings without coherent P–QRS–T morphology, and from ~0.12 s onward there is complete signal dropout, all of which indicates acquisition artifact rather than true cardiac activity. The erratic “hash” is simultaneous and diffuse, involving both limb and precordial channels, consistent with static noise affecting the entire recording rather than a localized lead. Final answer: static noise is present in all leads — I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1–V6.
