In the provided 10-second, 12-lead recording, usable signal is only present for roughly the first 120 ms; thereafter all leads are flatlined, and the brief initial segment is heavily contaminated by baseline drift, static/burst noise, and likely pacemaker-related artifact. Within that short window there appears to be, at most, a single ventricular depolarization with large precordial deflections (V5–V6), but there are no serial RR intervals, no visible series of P–QRS–T complexes, and no opportunity to identify a premature beat with altered coupling interval, aberrant QRS morphology, or a compensatory pause. Given the overwhelming artifact and the absence of multiple beats to compare, there is no reliable morphological evidence of a premature atrial or ventricular contraction in the data provided. Final answer: No.
