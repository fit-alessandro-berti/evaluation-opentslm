Inspecting lead V4 over the brief nonzero segment (first ~0.12 s), the signal shows abrupt, irregular, millisecond-to-millisecond amplitude swings (e.g., jumping from roughly −0.28 to +0.32 mV and then to −0.54 and −2.23 mV within tens of milliseconds) without any gradual, low-frequency wandering of the isoelectric line that would be expected with baseline drift; there is no discernible P–QRS–T morphology, and the trace then flatlines to zero, suggesting artifact or lead interruption rather than respiratory or positional baseline shift. Such erratic, high-frequency fluctuations and spikes are characteristic of static/electrode noise rather than a slow baseline wander. Final answer: static noise.
