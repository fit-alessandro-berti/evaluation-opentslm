Lead V1 shows abrupt, high-amplitude, rapidly alternating deflections during the first 120 ms (e.g., swings from about +3.8 mV to −3.4 mV within 10 ms steps) that are non-physiologic for P–QRS–T morphology and out of proportion to other leads, consistent with burst noise and electrode motion artifact rather than true cardiac activity; immediately thereafter the V1 trace is completely flat at exactly 0 for the remainder of the recording, which strongly suggests a lead-off or channel dropout artifact rather than normal isoelectric intervals. Yes, there is clear noise in lead V1 (burst/electrode artifact with subsequent lead-off/dropout).
