The recording is dominated by artifact: after approximately 120 ms, all channels flatline at zero, indicating signal dropout, and within the brief initial window there is no recognizable physiologic P–QRS–T morphology. Instead, leads I and II exhibit abrupt, high-amplitude sample-to-sample reversals (swinging from about +7 to −8 within 10 ms), which is characteristic of high‑frequency static interference rather than cardiac activity; the augmented limb leads show smaller, more gradual shifts, and the precordial leads V1–V6 appear comparatively smoother with less jitter over that short segment. Given the pattern of rapid, chaotic deflections, static noise is most evident in leads I and II. Final answer: Leads I and II.
