Despite the marked noise and the very short usable segment at the start of the trace, there is an early ectopic complex around 60–100 ms that stands out as a large, premature, morphologically different beat across multiple leads, without a clearly preceding P wave and with a broad, bizarre QRS configuration discordant to the baseline deflections; in a paced patient there is no preceding pacer spike associated with this beat, making a paced capture unlikely. These features favor a ventricular origin rather than a supraventricular premature beat (which would typically have a preceding P′ and a narrow QRS unless aberrantly conducted). Final answer: ventricular extrasystole (premature ventricular complex).
