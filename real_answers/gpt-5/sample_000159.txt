This tracing is profoundly compromised by baseline drift, burst/static noise, electrode artifact, and what appears to be extensive signal drop-out (the majority of the 10-second record is flatlined at zero), and there is a pacemaker with paced complexes that further limits ST–T interpretation; as a result, consistent P–QRS–T morphology and reliable intervals cannot be measured, and I do not see reproducible, sustained ST-segment elevation or clear pathological Q waves in the inferior (II, III, aVF) or lateral (I, aVL, V5–V6) leads with appropriate reciprocal changes to support an acute inferolateral myocardial infarction, nor are there stable, well-formed ST depressions or T-wave inversions that can be confidently attributed to ischemia rather than pacing-related secondary repolarization changes or artifact; at most, any brief deviations in the early samples are non-diagnostic and could reflect noise or pacing. Final answer: ischemic in inferior leads — uncertain.
