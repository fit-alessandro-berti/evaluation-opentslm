Only the first ~120 ms of the 10‑s tracing contains signal; the remainder is flat (likely data dropout rather than true asystole given the documented baseline drift, static/burst noise, and electrode artifacts). In that brief segment, there is a sharp, simultaneous high‑amplitude deflection across all leads consistent with a pacing artifact followed by a broad ventricular depolarization, but there are not enough cycles to assess rate, regularity, P‑wave activity, PR interval, or to characterize any specific ectopic morphology. With the available data and the stated recording flags, the rhythm finding that can be supported is a paced rhythm with intermittent extrasystoles (ectopic beats).
