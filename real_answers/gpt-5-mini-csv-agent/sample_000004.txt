On inspection of the provided time series the usable ECG data is essentially limited to the first ~12 samples (≈0.12 s at 100 Hz) with the remaining 988 samples effectively zeroed, and the tracing shows clear recording issues noted in the header (baseline wander, static/burst noise and electrode artifact); within those initial samples there is a very sharp, high-frequency positive deflection seen across multiple leads around 0.06–0.07 s that is more consistent with a pacing/artifact spike than a physiologic P-QRS-T sequence, there are no clearly discernible P waves or a reliable sequence of QRS complexes from which to measure rates or intervals, and the short duration and heavy contamination prevent accurate measurement of PR, QRS or QT intervals or any ST-segment assessment; because only a fraction of a beat (or possibly a pacing spike and a single depolarization) is present and the remainder of the record is flat, I cannot exclude paced beats or ventricular ectopy but I also cannot make standard diagnostic calls (ischemia, bundle branch block, prolonged QT, etc.) from this file. Final answer: yes — the recording is abnormal (prominent pacing/artifact spike(s), marked noise/artifact and an essentially truncated/flatlined remainder of the recording), and the tracing is uninterpretable for routine diagnostic conclusions until a clean, full-length ECG is obtained.
