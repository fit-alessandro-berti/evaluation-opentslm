I inspected the supplied 12-lead, 10-second recording sampled at 100 Hz and found that only the first ~0.12 seconds (12 samples) contain non-zero signal while the remainder of the file is flat/zero; this severe truncation plus the documented baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefacts meaningfully limit what can be measured or interpreted. In the short available segment the leads show very abrupt, high-slope deflections with large, brief positive and negative excursions across limb and precordial leads and clear rapid derivatives at several adjacent samples, a morphology that is most consistent with a single depolarization event that includes narrow high-frequency transients immediately preceding large QRS-like deflections; these transients are compatible with pacemaker stimulus spikes (and the clinical note confirms a pacemaker is present). Because only a few samples are present, reliable measurement of PR, QRS duration, QT, ST-segment or axis is not possible and small-amplitude or late potentials cannot be excluded; similarly, apparent isolated abrupt deflections could represent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or simply electrode/artifact noise and cannot be confidently distinguished here. Final diagnostic summary: the recording most consistently shows paced ventricular complexes (paced rhythm) with marked recording artefact and baseline disturbance, and there is a possible but uncertain finding of isolated premature ventricular beats (PVCs); interval measurements and ST-T interpretations are not possible from this truncated, noisy trace.
