Inspecting the provided time series (100 Hz sampling) shows that almost all leads contain meaningful signal only in the first ~0.11 seconds (rows 0–11); the remainder of the 10 s file is effectively zeroed, so we have only a very brief fragment to analyze. In that fragment there are one or possibly two large deflections across the limb and precordial leads (a prominent biphasic/positive complex centered roughly 0.02–0.04 s in several leads) followed by small-amplitude values and then flat/zero traces, and the recording notes baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefact which further degrade the trace; because there is at most a single clear complex there is no series of consecutive QRS complexes from which to measure RR intervals, compute heart rate, or evaluate regularity, and I cannot reliably see narrow, time-locked pacing spikes preceding the complexes (pacemaker presence is noted in the clinical context but spikes are not clearly identified in the available fragment). Because morphology, interval measurement (PR, QRS duration, QT) and rhythm regularity require multiple beats and adequate signal length/quality, the extremely short, noisy fragment here precludes diagnosing rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation, recurrent extrasystoles, sustained brady- or tachyarrhythmia, or pacemaker-mediated rhythms. Final answer: no definitive rhythm-related diagnosis can be made from this recording — the data are insufficient and inconclusive for identifying rhythm-related symptoms.
