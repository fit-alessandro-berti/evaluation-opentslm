Examining the raw 10-second, 100 Hz time series shows that only the first ~12 samples (0.00–0.12 s) contain nonzero ECG activity and that from 0.12 s onward all leads are flat at zero, which already indicates a recording artifact or data dropout rather than a continuous physiological tracing; within that initial 0.00–0.12 s segment there are abrupt, nonphysiologic, large-amplitude deflections that are essentially simultaneous across all 12 leads (for example sharp swings near indices 8 and 11 with amplitudes around –1.7 to –1.8 mV) rather than organized P-QRS-T morphology, and short-window spectral/energy analysis reveals a transient elevation in high-frequency energy during that brief interval; the combination of (a) very rapid, irregular, high-frequency/high-amplitude deflections affecting all leads at once and (b) an immediate transition to a prolonged flatline is most consistent with transient external/intermittent interference and electrode/recording artifact (burst noise) rather than true cardiac events, so yes — burst noise is present (confined to the initial ~0.00–0.12 s of this recording).
