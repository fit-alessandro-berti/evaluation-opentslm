The raw 10-second recording sampled at 100 Hz is essentially non-diagnostic: only the first 12 samples contain nonzero values and the remainder of the trace is flatline (zero), so there is no continuous P–QRS–T sequence to examine, measure, or average. Within those initial samples there is a brief, high-amplitude transient consistent with an electrode/pulse artifact or burst noise rather than a complete cardiac cycle, and I cannot identify discrete P waves, a reproducible QRS complex, J-point, ST segment, or T-wave morphology across multiple beats; pacemaker activity is reported in the clinical context but no consistent pacing spikes or paced QRS complexes are visible in the usable portion of the recording. Because baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and an effectively truncated signal prevent reliable measurement of QRS duration, J-point elevation/depression, pathological Q waves, or T-wave inversion, the ECG cannot be used to stage an infarction from this dataset — a repeat full 12-lead acquisition with corrected leads (and correlation with symptoms and serial cardiac enzymes) is required to determine whether changes consistent with hyperacute/acute, evolving, or old infarction are present.

Final answer: Indeterminate / ECG uninterpretable for infarction staging.
