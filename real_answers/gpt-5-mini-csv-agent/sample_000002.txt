I began by inspecting the Lead II time series (100 Hz) and applied a band-pass filter (≈0.5–40 Hz) to reduce baseline wander and high-frequency noise; a single clear ventricular complex was evident at ~0.11 s (large negative QRS in this lead), and because the recording shows marked baseline drift, noise and electrode/pacemaker artifact with only one well-formed beat early in the 10 s trace I limited the analysis to that beat. In the 50–110 ms window before the QRS I observed a distinct positive deflection consistent with a P wave (peak ≈0.07 s with amplitude ≈0.45 mV in lead II); using a conservative 10% of the P-peak amplitude to define onset and offset (and restricting the offset search to time before the QRS) gave an onset at ~0.06 s and an offset at ~0.10 s, corresponding to a P-wave duration of about 40 ms (measurement uncertainty is increased by the noisy baseline, limited number of beats, and presence of a pacemaker). Based on this measured P-wave duration compared with the usual normal upper limit (~120 ms), the P-wave duration for this ECG falls **within the normal range**.
