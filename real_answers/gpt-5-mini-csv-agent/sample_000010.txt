On inspecting the provided 10-second, 100 Hz time series I first looked at lead II (representative of the 12 leads) and found that non-zero cardiac signal is essentially confined to the first ~0.11 seconds (samples 0–11) while the remainder of the recording is flat at zero, which itself is a major recording artifact consistent with signal dropout or electrode disconnection; within that brief non-zero window the waveform shows very abrupt, large amplitude step changes and several single-sample/narrow transients (sharp upstrokes and downstrokes), the broadband power spectral estimate shows energy clustered at low frequency (near DC/≈0.4 Hz) together with notable energy around ~18–20 Hz, and a simple derivative-based detector flagged multiple very sharp excursions. Those findings—a long flatline after an initial noisy fragment, clear low-frequency wandering, narrow high-amplitude spikes, and elevated mid-range frequency content—are most consistent with multiple noise types rather than clean cardiac rhythm: low-frequency baseline wander and gross signal dropout (electrode detachment), superimposed high-frequency/static or myogenic interference and brief burst/noise transients/electrode artifacts; a definitive pacemaker spike is not clearly separable given the extremely short non-zero window and 100 Hz sampling, although narrow transients are present.
Final answer: **Yes — the ECG shows multiple noises (baseline drift/signal dropout, high-frequency/static noise, burst noise and electrode artifacts).**
