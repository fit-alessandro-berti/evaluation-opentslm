The tracing is very noisy and truncated, with baseline wander, electrode/pacing artifacts and only a brief segment of usable signal at the start, but examining the apparent QRS morphology in that usable window shows strong positive R waves in the precordial leads while the limb lead polarity is inconsistent; at the moment of maximal QRS amplitude the frontal plane lead I is essentially isoelectric-to-slightly-negative while aVF is clearly positive, which would indicate an inferior-directed but rightward-shifted frontal QRS vector rather than a clearly normal (+/-30Â°) axis; the presence of pacing artifacts and miswired/duplicated limb signals further degrades reliability, so the frontal plane axis here cannot be confidently classified as normal. 

No.
