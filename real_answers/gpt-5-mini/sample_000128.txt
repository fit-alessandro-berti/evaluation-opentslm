The early portion of the trace in V3 shows a plausible cardiac waveform with sharp deflections consistent with a QRS complex followed by rapid voltage swings, but after ~0.12 s the channel becomes zeroed out for the remainder of the recording, and the pre‑zero segment shows abrupt step changes and irregular high‑frequency fluctuations rather than a smooth baseline; these features are inconsistent with physiologic rhythm disturbance and instead reflect recording corruption (abrupt signal dropout/lead‑off) and transient burst/artefactual noise superimposed on baseline wander. The morphology and timing of the initial beats are similar to other leads, supporting that the V3 channel captured true cardiac activity briefly before an electrode/equipment artifact occurred, and there is no clear, repeatable pacemaker spike visible in V3 despite the clinical note of a pacemaker. Overall the pattern is dominated by artefact (baseline drift and sudden channel loss with burst noise) rather than a clean sustained ECG tracing. Yes — electrode artifact/lead‑off with burst noise.
