The recording is largely confined to the first ~120 ms with substantial baseline drift, noise and pacemaker-related/artefactual deflections that limit crisp delineation of components, but review of lead II shows a small positive atrial deflection beginning as the trace crosses from negative to positive between the 0.01–0.02 s samples and returning toward negative by about 0.04 s (the larger ventricular deflections and pacing/artefact are evident later around 0.05 s), which implies a P-wave onset roughly near 10–20 ms and offset near 40 ms giving an estimated P-wave duration on the order of 20–40 ms; even allowing for sampling and noise uncertainty this is markedly shorter than the commonly accepted upper limit of normal (~120 ms), and the presence of pacemaker spikes and artifact make any overestimation more likely than underestimation. Below normal.
