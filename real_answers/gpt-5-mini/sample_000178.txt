Reviewing the raw time series, the recording contains only a very brief period of nonzero waveform activity in the first ~0.12 seconds followed by essentially flat-line zeros for the remainder of the file, and the metadata warns of baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artefacts, extra-beat detection and a pacemaker; within the available nonzero segment there is a single large positive deflection but no clear sequence of beats, no identifiable premature narrow QRS complexes preceded by altered P waves (or consistent Pâ€² morphology), and no reproducible timing of premature beats to support the presence of early supraventricular impulses; given the extreme truncation/absence of diagnostic recording beyond the initial samples plus the artefacts and pacemaker interference, supraventricular extrasystoles cannot be demonstrated on this tracing. Final answer: No.
