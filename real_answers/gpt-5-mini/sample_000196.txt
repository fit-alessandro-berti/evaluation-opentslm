The available recording is severely limited and noisy: after ~0.11 s of nonzero signal the rest of the 10 s trace is flat/zero, and the study is flagged for baseline wander, static and burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacemaker being present, so beat morphology is not reliably visible; within the only measurable segment there is a single sharp waveform complex with large baseline disturbance but no clearly identifiable sequence of P wave → narrow QRS that would allow recognition of premature atrial (supraventricular) beats, and there are no clearly premature P waves with altered morphology or a compensatory pause visible; given the pacemaker and artifact it is also possible device spikes or noise triggered the “extra beats detected” flag rather than true PACs, so there is no reproducible electrocardiographic evidence of supraventricular extrasystoles in this recording. Final answer: No.
