The recording shows considerable artifact and baseline wander, but examination of the cardiac complexes in the usable early segment reveals low‑amplitude, late repolarization deflections that are flattened or inverted in the precordial leads and are small/indeterminate in the inferior leads; specifically, at the late portion of the complex (around the 0.10–0.11 s samples) the precordial leads (V1–V6) display negative/flattened T‑wave morphology compared with small or flat T‑wave deflections in the inferior limb leads, consistent with non‑specific ST‑T changes rather than a localized ischemic pattern (interpretation limited by noise and pacemaker/electrode artifact). Final answer: II, III, aVF and V1–V6.
