The trace shows a single abrupt, large-amplitude, relatively broad complex beginning around 0.06–0.09 s with rapid deflection across the limb and precordial leads and no clear preceding P-wave visible in the available segment; the QRS-like deflection is markedly different from the preceding baseline beats and appears wide and discordant across leads rather than a narrow, sharply defined QRS, and a sharp pacing/artifact spike is also suggested by the abrupt onset (with baseline drift and electrode noise noted which limit detail); these features — wide/bizarre QRS morphology, absence of an identifiable preceding atrial (P) wave, and a paced/ventricular-appearing complex — support a ventricular origin for the extra beats.  
Final answer: Ventricular extrasystoles.
