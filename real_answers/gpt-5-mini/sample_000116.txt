The recorded tracings show relatively low-amplitude QRS complexes across the limb and precordial leads in the available segment, with no very tall R waves in lateral leads (V5/V6) and no markedly deep S waves in V1/V2 that would fulfill usual Sokolow–Lyon or Cornell voltage thresholds for left ventricular hypertrophy; the largest observed peak values are well below the typical LVH cutoffs, and signal quality is further degraded by baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact and presence of a pacemaker which limits reliable amplitude measurement and interval assessment. The ST–T segments in the brief usable window do not show a reproducible, localized pattern of ischemic ST elevation or deep T-wave inversion, but there are minor, non-specific T-wave changes that are difficult to interpret confidently given the limited, noisy recording. Therefore, LVH voltage criteria are not met and the finding is best characterized as non-diagnostic T‑wave abnormalities. Final answer: non-diagnostic t abnormalities.
