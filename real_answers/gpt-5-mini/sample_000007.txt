The tracing shows only a very brief segment of cardiac signal (approximately the first 0.12 s) with repetitive lead-to-lead deflections that could represent a single QRS-like event but the recording is immediately followed by baseline zeros for the remainder of the file and the metadata warns of baseline drift, static and burst noise and electrode artifacts; although the report notes a pacemaker and "extra beats detected," I cannot identify distinct pacing spikes, count or measure RR intervals, or demonstrate sustained irregularity, rapid ventricular response, or organized atrial fibrillation from the available waveform because the long stretch of missing data and the noise make rhythm assessment unreliable; therefore no clear rhythm abnormality can be confirmed on this recording. Final answer: No â€” rhythm-related symptoms are not evident / the recording is non-diagnostic.
