The tracing is noisy with baseline wander, electrode and burst artifacts and pacemaker activity that limit confident interval measurement, but on the readable portion there are no convincing acute ST-segment elevations or hyperacute T waves and no dynamic ST-segment shifts; instead the QRS morphology is abnormal with small initial negative deflections and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads that, together with the lack of acute ST/T changes, is most consistent with a prior, healed infarction rather than an acute or evolving one. Final answer: old (healed) infarction.
