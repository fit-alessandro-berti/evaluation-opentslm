Examining lead III from the start of the recording shows a plausible cardiac waveform with rapid fluctuations consistent with a QRS/T sequence for the first ~0.12 s, followed by an abrupt and sustained loss of signal (values become exactly zero) for the remainder of the trace; this is not the gradual baseline wander or continuous high-frequency interference that characterizes static noise, nor is it a sustained change in morphology, but rather a sudden, isolated interruption of the channel consistent with an intermittent artifact or signal dropout; given the abrupt onset and short-lived nature of the disturbance (a discrete event rather than continuous contamination of the trace), this pattern is most consistent with burst noise. Final answer: burst noise.
