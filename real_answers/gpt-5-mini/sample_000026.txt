On inspection of the V1 time series, the early portion (0.00–0.11 s) shows abrupt, large-amplitude, high-frequency deflections with rapid polarity reversals and irregular baseline excursions that are not consistent with normal QRS/T morphology or physiologic pacing spikes at this sampling rate, and then the signal abruptly becomes a flat zero baseline from 0.12 s onward, indicating sudden signal loss or lead disconnection; these characteristics (irregular high‑frequency spikes/rapid baseline shifts followed by an abrupt flatline) are typical of electrode artifact/burst noise/equipment dropout rather than true cardiac activity, and in the clinical context (noted baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts and pacemaker presence) support that V1 contains noise and signal loss. Yes.
