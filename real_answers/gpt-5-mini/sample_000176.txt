The short captured portion shows large, abrupt deflections across the limb and precordial leads with very steep onset and broad opposite-polarity QRS-like waveforms (notably deep negative complexes in the precordial leads) and no clearly identifiable preceding P waves; there is also high-frequency, transient activity and baseline instability consistent with pacing/electrode artifact and the recording is heavily degraded by baseline drift, static and burst noise which limits beat-to-beat detail; an additional non‑sinus/extra beat was annotated during the recording. Taking the morphology (sharp high-amplitude spike-like onset, wide QRS-like complexes, loss of normal P–QRS–T relationships) together with the annotation, the definite findings are: ventricular paced rhythm (pacemaker present) and presence of extra (ectopic) beats.
