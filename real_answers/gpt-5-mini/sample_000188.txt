On inspecting the V4 time series, there is a brief, physiologic-looking signal in the first ~0.12 seconds with a large deflection (peak ~2.46) that correlates with similar activity in the other leads, followed by an abrupt transition to a flat, zero baseline for the remainder of the recording; this pattern is most consistent with a very short captured segment then signal dropout or lead-off/data clipping rather than ongoing, high-frequency, irregular baseline disturbance; static noise typically appears as continuous jagged/high-frequency interference superimposed on the trace, which is not present here (instead V4 becomes essentially flat), and although electrode artifacts and burst noise are noted in the overall recording, the V4 channel does not show the characteristic noisy oscillations throughoutâ€”Answer: No.
