The tracing shows nonphysiologic, abrupt high-amplitude fluctuations in the first ~0.12 seconds and then a sudden loss of signal (flatline) for the remainder; specifically lead aVL has rapid swings (for example a large positive excursion around 0.06 s to ~1.18 and a large negative excursion around 0.09 s to ~–1.31) that do not follow expected P–QRS–T morphology or timing and occur simultaneously with noted static/electrode artifact in the record, making true cardiac intervals and waveforms impossible to measure after the disturbance and consistent with transient electrical interference rather than intrinsic cardiac activity. Yes.
