The tracing shows large, early, sharply rising deflections in multiple leads with peak amplitudes around 2.0–2.5 units (for example lead I ~2.49 at ~0.10 s and substantial positive deflections in the precordial leads), suggesting very tall QRS complexes across the recording rather than isolated repolarization abnormalities; although signal quality issues (baseline wander, noise, electrode artifact and a noted pacemaker) limit detailed ST–T assessment, there is no clear, consistent isolated T-wave inversion or flattening pattern following the QRS that would indicate predominant nonspecific T‑wave changes, and the dominant feature is the high-amplitude ventricular complexes seen across limb and precordial leads — high QRS voltage.
