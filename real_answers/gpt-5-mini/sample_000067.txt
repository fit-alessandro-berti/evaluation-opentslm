The tracing shows a single, early, wide and bizarre QRS complex with large negative deflection in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and a markedly abnormal ventricular-looking morphology across the chest leads, occurring without a clear preceding P wave and with a relatively short coupling interval versus the expected sinus beat; the QRS appears prolonged (on the order of ~100 ms in this sampled segment) and the T-wave/ST segments are discordant to the QRS, all features consistent with a ventricular-origin premature beat rather than a supraventricular premature complex with aberrancy; although a pacemaker is noted in the record, no sharp pacing spike is clearly identified preceding this beat. Final answer: premature ventricular complex (PVC).
