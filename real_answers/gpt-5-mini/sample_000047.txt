The short recording shows an abrupt, early ventricular complex without a clear preceding P wave and with a markedly abnormal, discordant QRS morphology across the precordial leads (large initial deflection in V1–V3 followed by deep opposite deflections), and the complex appears wider and more "bizarre" than the surrounding baseline beats despite baseline noise and artifacts; these features—lack of an antecedent atrial (P) wave, a premature timing, and a wide, abnormal QRS—are most consistent with a premature ventricular contraction (PVC).
