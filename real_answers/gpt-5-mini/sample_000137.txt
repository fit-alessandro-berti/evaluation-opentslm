The recorded tracings are heavily affected by baseline wander, static and burst noise, electrode artifact and an obvious pacemaker rhythm, with a very sharp high-amplitude deflection around 0.11 s consistent with a pacing spike followed by an abnormally broad/negative QRS morphology; the precordial leads in the small captured window show large rapid deflections but no clearly definable isoelectric ST segment or distinct T-wave morphology because the QRS is dominated by pacing and the recording is abbreviated and noisy, extra beats are present and multiple leads show abrupt baseline shifts that would distort measurement of J-point or Q waves; given the paced QRS complexes and poor signal quality, there is no reliable evidence of acute ST-elevation, hyperacute T waves, or classic evolving ST-T changes that could be confidently staged, and any Q-waves or residual ST abnormalities cannot be confidently distinguished from pacing-related or artifact effects. Final answer: Indeterminate â€” stage of infarction cannot be reliably determined from this ECG.
