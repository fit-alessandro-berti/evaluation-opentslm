The available time series is extremely limited and degraded: nonzero signal appears only in the first ~0.06–0.12 seconds of the recording while the remainder of the 10 s trace is zeroed out, and the header already documents baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact with a pacemaker present; because of this there are no complete, clearly delineated QRS–T complexes or measurable RR intervals across the recording and the T wave end cannot be identified reliably for QT measurement (and therefore QTc cannot be calculated against heart rate). Normal QT assessment in a male requires identification of the QRS onset and T wave offset (and correction for rate, e.g. QTc <450 ms), none of which are possible here given the truncated/noisy trace and pacing/artifact. Final answer: the QT interval cannot be reliably assessed from this ECG (cannot determine whether it is within the normal range).
