On careful review of the available waveform, the tracing is limited by significant baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacemaker presence with extra beats, all of which make reliable measurement of small P‑wave morphology difficult; I looked for the classic signs of right atrial overload (tall, peaked "P pulmonale" P waves in the inferior leads—especially lead II—and a prominent initial positive P component in V1) but did not see a consistent, reproducible, sharply peaked P wave in leads II/III/aVF nor a dominant initial P‑wave deflection in V1 that would meet standard criteria; PR interval and P‑wave duration/amplitude measurement are unreliable here because of noise and pacing artifacts, so no clear ECG evidence of isolated right atrial enlargement is present. Final answer: No.
