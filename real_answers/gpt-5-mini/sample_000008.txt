The brief usable portion of the tracing is noisy and interrupted by pacing-related artifact and baseline wander, but inspection of the waveform suggests wide, paced QRS complexes with large positive deflections in the lateral precordial leads and an early deep negative deflection in the anterior leads rather than persistent ST-segment elevation or tall, symmetric hyperacute T waves; there is no clear, sustained ST elevation after the QRS in the available samples and no evolving pattern over time in this recording (the rest of the file is zeroed), which argues against an acute ST-elevation phase and is more consistent with prior (healed) infarction changes that can include paced/abnormal QRS morphology and fixed Q waves; interpretation is limited by pacemaker artifact and poor signal quality. Final answer: old (healed) myocardial infarction.
