The tracing in lead I shows a brief period of variable, high-amplitude deflections in the first ~0.12 s that are irregular in shape and amplitude (suggesting burst/static noise and a wandering baseline), followed by an abrupt and complete loss of signal from 0.12 s onward (a persistent zero baseline across the recording), which is most consistent with electrode/lead-off artifact or signal dropout rather than a physiologic change; there are no clear, consistent pacemaker spikes or interpretable QRS complexes after the initial segment, and the sudden step to a flatline indicates a technical artifact rather than true cardiac asystole. Answer: Yes â€” electrode/lead-off artifact with burst/static noise (signal dropout).
