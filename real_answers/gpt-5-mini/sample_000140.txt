The recorded tracings in the available time window show clear large QRS deflections in the precordial leads — in lead V4 the signal moves from about -1.50 mV to +1.49 mV across the early samples, indicating a prominent R/S complex rather than a small repolarization deflection; however the time series is effectively truncated after ~120 ms with the remainder of the recording set to zero and the report notes baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats and a pacemaker, all of which degrade reliable repolarization assessment. Because the T wave normally falls well after the QRS (typically 200–400 ms after the QRS onset) and that portion of the waveform is not present (and is confounded by noise/artifacts and possible pacing), the morphology and amplitude of the T wave in V4 cannot be accurately measured from these data. Final answer: cannot confirm — the T‑wave in lead V4 is not adequately recorded/assessable, so low‑amplitude T‑wave cannot be determined.
