The available time series is severely limited and corrupted: meaningful signal is present only for the first ~0.12 seconds and the remainder of the 10 s trace is zeros, and the recording metadata notes baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats and a pacemaker; within the brief nonzero window the tracings show large, rapid deflections consistent with pacing spikes and artifact rather than clean QRSâ€“T morphology, there is no clear, isolated QRS onset-to-T-wave end interval that can be reliably measured, the paced complexes and noise distort repolarization so the T-wave end cannot be identified with confidence and heart rate (RR) cannot be established for QT correction; because of these limitations and confounding by pacemaker-related morphology, a reliable QT (or corrected QT) cannot be determined from this recording. Final answer: cannot be determined from this ECG.
