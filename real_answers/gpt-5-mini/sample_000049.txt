The recorded tracing shows a single clear QRS–T sequence followed by baseline instability and extensive artifact, but within the analyzable beat the precordial (V1–V3) leads demonstrate an R wave followed by a relatively down‑sloping segment that sits below the preceding baseline level before the T wave (i.e., ST depression), while the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6) do not show convincing localized ST elevation; the pattern is more consistent with diffuse/subendocardial-type ST depression affecting the anteroseptal leads rather than focal ST elevation of anterolateral ischemia, recognizing that signal noise and pacemaker/electrode artifact limit precision. Final answer: subendocardial injury in anteroseptal leads.
