The trace shows brief, rapidly changing waveforms in all leads during the first ~0.1–0.12 s followed by an abrupt step to flat zero values for the remainder of the recording rather than a slowly wandering baseline; this pattern is not consistent with low‑frequency, cyclical baseline wander from respiration or movement (which would produce gradual baseline shifts over seconds) but instead reflects a sudden transient disruption or dropout of the signal consistent with a short-duration artifact; because the abnormality is abrupt and localized (a sharp transition to flatline) rather than a slow drift that would alter ST/T morphology or baseline over the whole record, it is best characterized as burst noise. Answer: burst noise.
