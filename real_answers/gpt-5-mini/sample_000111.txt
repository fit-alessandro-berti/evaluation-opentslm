On inspection of the raw time series the recording shows usable cardiac signals only in the first ~120 ms with clear rapid deflections consistent with QRS activity and then an abrupt loss to zero for the remainder of the trace (suggesting recording dropout or severe artifact); within the initial epoch the precordial chest leads, particularly V4–V6, display markedly larger, irregular high-amplitude deflections (steep, nonphysiologic jumps to ~1–2.5 mV) compared with the limb leads and the early QRS complexes, consistent with localized static/continuous noise or electrode artifact in those leads rather than true cardiac morphology; baseline drift and burst noise are also noted in the record and a pacemaker/extra-beat notation increases the likelihood of superimposed noncardiac signals. Final answer: leads V4, V5, and V6.
