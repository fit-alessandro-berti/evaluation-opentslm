The tracing shows only a very brief segment of recognizable ECG activity at the start (up to ~0.11 s) with the remainder of the recording consisting of zeros and extensive signal artefact noted in the metadata; within the interpretable portion there appears to be at most a single QRS-like deflection (and pacemaker-related activity is reported), so there are not two clear successive R waves from which to measure an RR interval reliably; baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefacts further limit accurate detection. Because a valid RR interval requires at least two consecutive, well-defined R peaks and this recording lacks that (and/or is truncated), the RR interval cannot be confidently measured and it is therefore impossible to conclude that it falls above the normal range. Final answer: Unable to determine.
