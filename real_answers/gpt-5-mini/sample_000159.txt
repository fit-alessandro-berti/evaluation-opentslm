The tracing is limited by a short usable segment, baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacing artifact which make precise ST measurements unreliable, but on inspection the paced/ventricular-type complexes do not show convincing, localized ST elevation in the lateral precordial or limb leads (V5–V6, I, aVL) that would support a definite inferolateral ST‑elevation MI, whereas the most consistent ST/T abnormalities are seen in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) with altered T‑wave/QRS relationships suggestive of ischemia rather than a clear transmural infarct; given the pacemaker, extra beats and poor signal quality the picture is uncertain but favors ischemic changes in the inferior leads. Final answer: ischemic in inferior leads (including uncertain).
