The recording shows brief, plausible multi-lead cardiac activity for the first ~0.12 s with differing amplitudes across limb and precordial leads, followed by an abrupt and complete loss of signal (all 12 leads reporting exactly zero) for the remainder of the trace; this pattern is not physiologic (a global sudden cessation of electrical activity would not manifest as perfectly flat, identical zeros across leads while the monitor continues) and strongly indicates a technical fault such as lead/cable disconnection, equipment gating or data-storage dropout, or electrodes losing contact; the provided signal-quality annotations (baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts) and the mention of a pacemaker further support that artifacts and technical issues were present rather than a true sustained cardiac electrical silence, so the most likely explanation is electrode/equipment problem requiring repeat ECG with lead impedance checks. Final answer: Yes â€” electrode/equipment problems are present.
