The recorded tracings show only a brief burst of waveform data in the first ~0.12 seconds followed by flatlines, and the recording is degraded by baseline drift, static and burst noise and electrode artifact, which makes precise interval measurement difficult; within the available segment there are abrupt, very sharp deflections followed immediately by large, wide, high-amplitude QRS-like excursions that are discordant in the limb and precordial leads (i.e., not the normal narrow, smoothly progressive QRS/T morphology), and the timing is consistent with a short-duration pacing spike immediately preceding a wide, abnormal QRS; the presence of reported extra beats and the known pacemaker in the clinical note further supports that these are paced complexes rather than intrinsic narrow-complex QRS complexes. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm with pacemaker spikes and paced (wide) QRS complexes.
