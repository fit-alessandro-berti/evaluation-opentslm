The trace shows only a brief segment of apparent cardiac signal in the first ~0.12 s with some lead-to-lead similarity and then an abrupt and complete loss of signal (all leads are exactly zero) for the remainder of the recording, which is not physiologic; additionally there are identical or repeated values across multiple leads at specific timepoints and a sudden step to a uniform value just before the zeros, all features consistent with equipment or lead/electrode disconnection or saturation rather than a true cardiac change (the metadata noting baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifacts supports this), so this recording demonstrates electrode/lead problems. Yes.
