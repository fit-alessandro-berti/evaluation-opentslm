The recording shows a single clear cardiac complex in the very early portion of the trace with marked baseline wander and multiple artifacts thereafter that render most of the 10 s unusable for interval averaging; noise and electrode/pacemaker-related artifacts limit reliable identification of successive beats, P waves and T-wave end points. In the analysable segment the main positive R peak occurs at ~0.04 s (lead II) preceded by a sharp negative deflection at ~0.02–0.03 s and returning toward baseline by ~0.06 s, so the QRS complex can be localized but there are insufficient consecutive beats to determine a stable RR interval (heart rate), PR interval or QT reliably; given the noisy/truncated signal P‑wave onset and T‑wave offset are not measurable with confidence. Final answer (numeric features that are measurable and fall within normal limits): QRS duration ≈ 40 ms (within normal <120 ms); R‑wave amplitude in lead II ≈ 2.11 (units as recorded) and in V5 ≈ 2.31 (units as recorded) — amplitudes that are not abnormally low/high for limb/precordial leads.
