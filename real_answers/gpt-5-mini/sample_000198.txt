The recording is noisy and brief with pacemaker/electrode artefact but the available beat shows a dominant early positive deflection in the anteroseptal precordial leads (V1–V3) without the horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depressions that would be expected for diffuse subendocardial ischemia, and there is no localized ST elevation in V1–V4 to suggest acute transmural anteroseptal injury; limb-lead morphology shows predominantly negative deflection in lead I with relatively rightward frontal-plane forces rather than the diffuse ST changes of subendocardial injury, and the pattern is more consistent with an axis/posterior fascicular conduction abnormality than with isolated subendocardial anteroseptal injury — Left posterior fascicular block.
