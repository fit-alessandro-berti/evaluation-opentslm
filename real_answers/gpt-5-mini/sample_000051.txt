On inspection of the time series the tracing shows brief, physiologic-looking deflections in the very early samples followed by an abrupt loss of signal for the majority of the recording and intermittent abrupt amplitude excursions in the initial segment; the early portion includes slow shifts in the apparent baseline between beats (suggesting low‑frequency baseline wander), superimposed irregular high‑amplitude, short‑duration excursions and rapid fluctuations (consistent with burst/static noise), and then a prolonged segment of near‑zero values consistent with electrode lead disconnection or electrode artifact (sudden loss of lead contact or artifact). There are no clean, consistent, narrow pacing spikes visible in the data provided, but the abrupt transient high‑voltage deflections and the long periods of flatline strongly point to electrode artifacts plus both baseline drift and intermittent burst/static noise. Final answer: baseline drift (baseline wander), static noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts.
