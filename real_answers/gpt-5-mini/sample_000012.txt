The tracing shows a single clear ventricular complex in the first 0.12 s of the recording with the remainder of the file zeroed/out (and marked by substantial baseline drift, noise and a pacemaker presence), and because the sample rate is 100 Hz each sample equals 10 ms. In lead II the complex begins as a small positivity at 0.00–0.01 s followed by a rapid negative deflection at 0.02 s and a large positive peak around 0.04 s with return toward baseline by about 0.05–0.06 s; the high‑frequency noise and possible pacemaker artifact make precise fiducial points imperfect, but using the earliest clear onset near 0.01 s and the return toward baseline by ~0.06 s gives an estimated QRS duration on the order of 40–60 ms, which is well below conventional prolonged/QRS‑wide cutoffs. Final answer: No.
