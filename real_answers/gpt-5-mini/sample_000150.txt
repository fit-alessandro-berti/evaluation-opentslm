The tracing shows a prominent early precordial QRS complex with marked positive deflections in the anterior leads (V1–V4) compared with baseline, and the post‑QRS segment in those precordial leads remains elevated relative to the preceding PR baseline despite baseline wander and artifact; limb‑lead lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6) do not show isolated, greater ST elevation than the anterior precordial leads, and with the presence of pacemaker and noise the most consistent and localized abnormality is ST elevation in the anteroseptal (precordial V1–V4) distribution — anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
