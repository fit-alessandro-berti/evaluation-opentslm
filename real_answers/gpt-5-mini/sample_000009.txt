The tracing shows very limited usable data: after ~0.12 s the multi‑lead record is essentially flatlined (likely signal dropout) and the recording is noted to have baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact, so assessment is constrained; within the initial 0.00–0.12 s window there is a single large, nearly simultaneous deflection across limb and precordial leads (prominent positive deflections in lateral leads V4–V6) without a clear preceding P wave and without well‑defined, separate sharp pacing spikes visible at this sampling, suggesting a single wide ventricular complex that is consistent with a paced ventricular beat or a ventricular ectopic, but the morphology and timing cannot be reliably measured (QRS duration, PR interval, ST/T changes) because of low temporal resolution, noise and the very short segment of data; the report of a pacemaker and of extra beats during recording aligns with a paced rhythm or intermittent ventricular ectopy, but classification of those extra beats as paced beats vs PVCs, and any assessment for ischemic ST‑T changes, atrial arrhythmia (eg, AF), or conduction block is uncertain and not possible from this noisy, truncated recording. 

Final answer: Evidence of a ventricular paced/ventricular (wide) complex (pacemaker present) with suspected additional premature ventricular beats/extra beats (uncertain whether paced or PVC); overall recording quality is poor so ischemia, atrial rhythm and conduction abnormalities cannot be reliably assessed.
