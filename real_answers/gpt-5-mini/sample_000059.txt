The available trace shows a single clear ventricular complex occurring between about 0.01 and 0.11 s with the remainder of the recording zeroed out and multiple signal-quality issues (baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artefact) and a pacemaker noted, so rhythm and rate calculations are not reliable from this file; morphologically the main depolarisation begins near 0.01 s and returns toward baseline by ~0.11 s, giving a QRS duration on the order of 100 ms, and the largest positive deflections in lead II reach about 1.4–1.5 mV (with other precordial leads in a similar 1.5–1.6 mV range), but PR interval, QT/QTc and accurate axis cannot be confidently measured from the truncated/noisy record. Final answer: QRS duration ≈100 ms (within normal limits) and peak R-wave amplitude in lead II ≈1.5 mV (within expected normal range).
