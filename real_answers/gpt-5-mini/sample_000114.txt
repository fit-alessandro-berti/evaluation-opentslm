The available ECG tracing is noisy, truncated and dominated by baseline wander and electrode/pacemaker artifact so that reliable QRS net vectors cannot be measured across the limb leads; the brief nonzero samples at the start show mixed small positive and negative deflections in leads I, II and the augmented limb leads rather than a clear, consistently negative lead I and positive aVF pattern that would support a leftward shift, and with a pacemaker present and many signal samples thereafter zeroed-out the usual methods (net QRS in leads I and aVF or the hexaxial reference) cannot be applied confidently; therefore the axis is indeterminate from this recording. Final answer: Indeterminate (cannot reliably assess for left axis deviation).
