The recording shows a single clear cardiac cycle with a sharp QRS complex (large negative deflection at ~0.03 s followed by rapid return) and a subsequent elevated segment before the T-wave-like repolarization; comparing the presumed PR/isolectric baseline just before the QRS (lead II ~0.28 mV, V5 ~0.42 mV) with the early post‑QRS values (J‑point region at ~0.05 s: lead II ~0.68 mV, III ~0.66 mV, aVF ~0.60 mV, V5 ~0.80 mV, V6 ~0.96 mV) demonstrates ST‑segment elevations on the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and lateral/precordial leads (notably V5–V6) of a magnitude (several tenths of a millivolt, i.e. multiple mm) that is consistent with localized ST elevation rather than diffuse nonspecific shifts; while baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact and the presence of a pacemaker can distort morphology and warrant caution, the pattern of contiguous ST elevation in inferior and lateral leads strongly suggests an acute or recent inferolateral myocardial infarction. Final answer: myocardial infarction in inferolateral leads.
