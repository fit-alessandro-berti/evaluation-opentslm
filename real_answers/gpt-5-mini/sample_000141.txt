Looking at the V1 trace step by step, the lead shows large-amplitude, irregular, rapid oscillations that begin at the start of the recording (around 0.00 s) and persist continuously through the measurable segment (~0.00–0.11 s) rather than appearing as isolated, brief spikes; these oscillations distort the expected QRS and baseline morphology (there are very large positive and negative swings up to ~±5 units) and are present across consecutive samples rather than confined to a single sample or a very short epoch, which argues for a sustained interference such as myopotential or baseline wander/electrode-related continuous noise; by contrast, burst noise would present as short, sudden transient spikes or single-sample jumps interrupting otherwise normal segments. Final answer: Static noise.
