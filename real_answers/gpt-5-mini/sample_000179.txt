The tracing is heavily limited by noise and an abrupt loss of signal after ~0.11 s, but in the evaluable segment there is a very rapid, sharp deflection followed almost immediately by a large, predominantly negative QRS‑like waveform that appears simultaneously across the limb and precordial leads, and no discrete, preceding P waves are seen; the sharp narrow deflection immediately before the wide QRS‑like complex is most consistent with a pacing artifact and the subsequent broad, uniform QRS morphology across leads is compatible with ventricular paced complexes. Baseline wander, static/burst noise and electrode artifacts obscure low‑amplitude features and prevent reliable measurement of PR or QRS durations or accurate heart rate calculation, and the presence of isolated nonphysiologic zeros indicates recording dropout rather than sustained asystole. Given the morphology (pacing spike followed by wide QRS) and the recording note of extra beats, the rhythm shows a ventricular paced rhythm with pacing spikes and associated extra (premature/ectopic) beats. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm (paced ventricular complexes) with extra/ectopic beats.
