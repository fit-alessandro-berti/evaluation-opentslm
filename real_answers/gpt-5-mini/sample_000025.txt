The recording is limited by marked baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and pacemaker activity and much of the trace is truncated to zero values, but in the analyzable early portion the QRS complexes in the lateral precordial/limb leads show prominent initial negative deflections and large-magnitude QRS changes rather than the classic tall, symmetric "hyperacute" T waves and pronounced ST elevation of an immediate/early STEMI; there is no clear sustained ST-segment elevation across multiple contiguous leads in the available samples and the tracings are more compatible with established Q‑wave–like changes and relatively flattened/normalizing ST segments—features that favor a later (evolving/middle) stage of infarction rather than the very early (hyperacute) stage. Final answer: middle stage of myocardial infarction.
