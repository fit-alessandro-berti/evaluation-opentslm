The tracing is severely limited by artifact and data loss, with most of the recording showing flat lines and only the first ~0.11 s containing measurable signal, so interpretation is constrained; within that initial segment there are very brief, highâ€‘amplitude, nearly simultaneous deflections across multiple leads followed immediately by broader, large deflections (and no clear preceding P waves or measurable PR intervals), which together with the stated presence of a pacemaker and prominent electrode/static noise make native conduction assessment unreliable but are most consistent with an electrically delivered paced impulse producing stimulus artifacts and paced QRS complexes rather than clear sinus complexes or isolated ectopy. Final answer: paced rhythm with pacemaker stimulus artifacts (ventricular paced beats).
