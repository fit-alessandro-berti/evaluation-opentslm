The recording is severely limited by noise and apparent signal dropout after ~0.12 s, with clear baseline drift and electrode/artifact contamination; within the usable early trace there are abrupt, high-frequency deflections followed by wide, large-amplitude QRS-like deflections rather than normal sharp narrow QRS complexes, and the onset of these deflections is temporally associated with brief sharp spikes consistent with pacemaker stimuli; the morphology and timing are most compatible with ventricular pacing (paced spikes with paced QRS complexes) rather than native sinus conduction, and the note of “extra beats detected” together with intermittent nonuniform complexes suggests occasional ventricular ectopic beats. Final interpretation: ventricular paced rhythm with occasional premature ventricular complexes (paced rhythm with PVCs).
