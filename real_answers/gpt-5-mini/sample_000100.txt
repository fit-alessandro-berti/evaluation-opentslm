On inspection of the provided time series the atrial activity cannot be reliably assessed: the trace is brief and heavily affected by baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode/pacemaker artifacts, and the recording appears truncated so clear, consistent P waves across multiple beats and leads are not available for measurement; the classic ECG criteria for right atrial enlargement (tall, peaked P waves in II >2.5 mm or a dominant, tall initial P-wave component in V1) are not demonstrable on the available data (there are no reproducible, clearly measured P-wave amplitudes or biphasic P-wave morphologies to apply standard thresholds). Because of these limitations there is no clear ECG evidence of right atrial overload/enlargement on this recording. Answer: No clear signs of right atrial enlargement (assessment limited by noise and pacemaker artifact).
