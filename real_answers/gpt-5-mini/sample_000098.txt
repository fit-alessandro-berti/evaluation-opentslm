The recording shows only brief, isolated cardiac activity at the start of the trace with abrupt, high-amplitude, very narrow deflections visible across multiple leads immediately preceding QRS-like complexes, followed by a prolonged period of flatlined/zeroed signal likely related to recording artifact; there is substantial baseline drift and burst/electrode noise noted in the metadata, and the tracings lack a sustained, rapid, regular series of narrow QRS complexes or continuous tachycardic rhythm that would be required to diagnose supraventricular tachycardia â€” instead the morphology is most consistent with pacing spikes and paced complexes with capture in the brief usable portion of the strip, and no evidence of a continuous high atrial rate or rapid ventricular response; therefore this ECG demonstrates a normal functioning artificial pacemaker.
