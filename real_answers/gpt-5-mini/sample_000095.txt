The trace contains only a very brief epoch of true cardiac signal (about the first 0.11 s) followed by essentially flatlines for the remainder of the file and is heavily corrupted by baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefact, which limits assessment; within the recorded epoch there are very sharp, high‑frequency deflections preceding broad deflections across multiple leads (and near‑identical deflections in limb leads I/II), consistent with extrinsic pacing artefact followed by a paced ventricular complex rather than native P waves and narrow QRS morphology, so the recording demonstrates pacemaker spikes with a ventricular paced beat (paced rhythm) along with significant signal artefact/data loss.
