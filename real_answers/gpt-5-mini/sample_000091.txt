The recording quality is poor (baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact) and the digital file appears truncated so only the first ~0.11 s contains physiologic signal, which limits full interval measurements and rhythm strip assessment; within that brief segment there is a very sharp, high-frequency deflection followed almost immediately by large-amplitude, broad deflections in the precordial leads without identifiable preceding P waves, and no normal narrow QRS–T morphology can be seen; the presence of a known pacemaker and the sharp pre‑QRS artifact-like signal followed by wide, atypical QRS morphology strongly suggest these are paced complexes rather than intrinsic sinus QRS complexes, and no clear native atrial activity is apparent on the sample. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm (paced ventricular beats with pacing artifact).
