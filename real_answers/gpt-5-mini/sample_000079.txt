The V2 tracing shows small irregular fluctuations and a brief high-amplitude negative excursion in the first ~0.1 s, followed by an abrupt and persistent return to exact zero for the remainder of the recording; this sudden loss of signal and flatline is not consistent with physiologic cardiac activity or simple baseline wander and is most typical of an electrode disconnection/lead-off type artifact, while the brief large deflection just before the flatline represents an intermittent, transient disturbance (a burst of high-amplitude noise) rather than continuous high‑frequency static or slow baseline drift. Final answer: Electrode artifact (lead‑off) with an intermittent burst noise.
