The trace shows only a very brief segment of cardiac activity followed by long stretches of zeroed signal and the recording metadata warns of baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact which limit interpretation; within the usable segment there is a sudden sharp deflection followed almost immediately by an abnormally large biphasic QRS-like complex without a clear preceding sinus P–QRS–T sequence, and given the documented presence of a pacemaker this pattern is most consistent with pacemaker artifact followed by paced QRS morphology (wide, atypical ventricular complexes) rather than intrinsic narrow-complex sinus beats; therefore, despite data quality limits, the rhythm finding is a paced (ventricular) rhythm — i.e., pacemaker-driven ventricular pacing.
