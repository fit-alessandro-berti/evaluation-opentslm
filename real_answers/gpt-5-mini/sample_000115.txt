The recorded waveform is limited to an initial ~0.12 s of meaningful signal followed by long stretches of flat/zero data and multiple documented recording artifacts, but within that initial segment there is a very sharp, large-amplitude, nearly simultaneous deflection across leads at ~0.02 s followed by broad high-amplitude QRS‑like deflections in the limb and precordial leads, a pattern most consistent with a pacemaker stimulus (narrow high‑voltage spike) immediately preceding paced ventricular complexes; the recording also contains baseline wander and static/burst noise and electrode artifact that degrade interpretation and the file notes extra beats during the tracing consistent with ectopic (premature) beats. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm with visible pacemaker spikes, premature (extra) beats (likely PVCs/ectopy), and significant baseline drift/noise/electrode artifact.
