The recorded signals show an initially noisy brief segment (about the first 0.11 s) with large, abrupt amplitude excursions and irregular high‑frequency fluctuations across leads, followed by an immediate and sustained loss of signal (flat zero values) for the remainder of the recording; the early large transient deflections and sample‑to‑sample jitter are most consistent with short bursts of high‑amplitude noise plus background static/high‑frequency noise, the gradual wandering of the baseline in the first segment is compatible with baseline drift (low‑frequency baseline wander), and the abrupt transition to a prolonged flatline across all leads is characteristic of electrode artifact or lead disconnection/lead‑off; taken together the recording demonstrates baseline drift, static (high‑frequency) noise, burst noise, and electrode artifacts (lead‑off).
