The trace for lead V5 shows large, abrupt, high-amplitude irregular fluctuations in the initial 0.00–0.11 s window with no clear, repeatable P‑QRS‑T morphology or consistent intervals, followed by an immediate collapse to a zero signal for the remainder of the recording, which is more consistent with transient high‑frequency/burst artefact or electrode/static interference rather than a slow, smooth low‑frequency wander of the baseline; baseline drift would present as gradual, low‑frequency wandering of the isoelectric line over many seconds, which is not seen here. Final answer: static noise.
