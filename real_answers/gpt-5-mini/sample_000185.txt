The lead II trace shows a few brief physiologic-looking deflections in the first ~0.12 s (alternating positive and negative swings up to ~0.8 mV) followed by an abrupt transition to an essentially constant zero level for the remainder of the recording, which indicates a sudden DC offset or loss of signal rather than ongoing high-frequency interference; baseline drift is characterized by slow, low-frequency wandering of the ECG baseline over seconds (with preserved beat morphology around that wander), whereas static noise manifests as rapid high-frequency jitter superimposed on the waveform and would not produce a prolonged, flat DC offset; given the abrupt step and prolonged offset/flatline consistent with electrode/electrical artifact and low-frequency baseline shift rather than continuous high-frequency contamination, the finding in lead II is best described as baseline drift. Answer: baseline drift.
