The initial 0.00â€“0.11 s portion of lead aVF shows rapid deflections consistent with cardiac complexes (large positive and negative swings over tens of milliseconds) rather than a slow, low-frequency baseline wander, and then the trace abruptly becomes zero from 0.12 s onward indicating signal dropout/electrode artifact; given the very short usable segment, the presence of static/burst noise, electrode artifacts and a pacemaker signal, a true low-frequency baseline wander across the recording cannot be reliably demonstrated in aVF, and there is no clear slow baseline drift visible in the available aVF data. No.
