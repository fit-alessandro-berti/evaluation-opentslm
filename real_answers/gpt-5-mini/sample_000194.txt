The recording is limited to a brief waveform segment with marked baseline drift, noise and pacing/electrode artifact that reduce confidence in precise ST measurements, but inspecting the waveform around the end of the QRS/early ST period (approximately 0.09–0.11 s) shows a downward displacement of the ST level relative to the preceding baseline in the inferior leads and lateral precordial leads; this appears most pronounced in leads II, III and aVF and is also seen in the lateral chest leads (V4–V6) with milder involvement of I and aVL, consistent with diffuse, non‑specific ST depression likely influenced by pacing/artifact. Final answer: non‑specific ST depression in II, III, aVF and V4–V6.
