The short portion of the tracing that contains signal (first ~0.12 s) shows low-amplitude baseline fluctuations followed by an abrupt, large, nearly simultaneous positive deflection across multiple limb and precordial leads (peak ~0.75–0.87 units around 0.06–0.09 s) with little or no preceding clear P‑wave and a broad, concordant QRS-like waveform that is present in all leads; this pattern, especially given the clinical note that a pacemaker is present and the recorded artifact/noise, is most consistent with an electrical pacing stimulus (a pacing spike or abrupt artifact) followed by ventricular capture producing paced QRS complexes rather than native narrow-complex sinus beats. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm (paced ventricular beats).
