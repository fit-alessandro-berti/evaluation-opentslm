The limb-lead time series shows a large biphasic QRS complex early in the trace with the dominant deflection in lead I being positive (peak amplitudes ~+2.7 to +2.85 mV) while the inferior lead aVF shows a dominant negative deflection (nadir ~-2.24 mV); lead II parallels lead I (positive) and the inferior leads (III, aVF) are predominantly negative, which places the mean frontal QRS vector directed leftward and superiorly. There is signal noise, baseline drift and pacemaker/electrode artifact noted that can distort exact amplitudes and intervals, and the tracings are brief and partially interrupted, but the consistent positivity in lead I with negativity in aVF is the key polarity pattern for frontal axis assessment.
