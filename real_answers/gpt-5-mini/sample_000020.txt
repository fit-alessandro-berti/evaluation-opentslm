The available tracing shows only a brief segment (~0–0.12 s) with measurable deflections across multiple leads followed by near-complete signal dropout (continuous zeros) for the remainder of the recording, and the header notes baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifacts; within the initial brief segment there are one or possibly two transient complexes but they are insufficient to define consistent P–QRS–T morphology, measure reliable intervals, or demonstrate pacemaker spikes, and the presence of prolonged flatline indicates major data loss or lead disconnection rather than a sustained cardiac rhythm; therefore the recording is non-diagnostic for rhythm or ischemic changes and cannot reliably demonstrate any symptom-related arrhythmia or pacemaker-related events. 

Final answer: No — no form-related symptoms are evident (recording is non‑diagnostic due to technical artifact/data loss).
