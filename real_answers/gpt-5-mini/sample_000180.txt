The tracing shows brief, low‑frequency cardiac activity at the start of the record with a small initial positive deflection in the limb leads around 30–40 ms and a larger negative deflection near 80 ms that is present across most leads, consistent with a QRS complex heavily affected by baseline drift, noise and pacing artifact; beyond about 120 ms the signal is essentially flat in all leads so the expected repolarization segment is poorly represented, but in the available post‑QRS window there is no obvious tall, peaked, inverted or biphasic T‑wave morphology—rather the waveform returns toward baseline with minimal amplitude relative to the QRS in all leads (and no clear ST‑segment elevation/depression pattern), findings more consistent with attenuated/flattened repolarization signals likely from low T‑wave voltages and recording artifact than with a discrete pathological T‑wave inversion or peaked abnormality. Final answer: low amplitude t-wave.
