The recording is limited by baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and pacemaker activity, so beat-to-beat is noisy and exact isoelectric reference is imperfect, but examining the waveform around the presumed ST interval (approximately 80–100 ms in the provided sample window) shows persistent negative displacement in the frontal limb leads: leads I and II show the largest discrete ST‐level negativity (values ~ -1.5 to -2.4 units at ~0.07–0.09 s) with lead III showing a smaller but consistent negative deflection, whereas the precordial leads V1–V6 and most augmented leads (aVL, aVF) in this segment are upright or minimally shifted; given the noise and baseline uncertainty this is best characterized as non‑specific ST depression most evident in the limb leads I and II (with mild depression in III).
