The tracing shows clear baseline instability and localized erratic, high-amplitude fluctuation confined to the precordial channels: limb leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF) remain relatively low-amplitude and coherent in the initial segment while V1â€“V6 display markedly larger, irregular deflections and abrupt amplitude changes inconsistent with normal cardiac morphology, and these precordial channels also show the kinds of nonphysiologic, high-frequency irregularity expected with static (electromagnetic) interference rather than true QRS/T morphology; given the morphology and distribution of the artifact, the leads with static noise are V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6.
