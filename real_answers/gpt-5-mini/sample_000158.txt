Examining the time series, the tracing shows very erratic, high-amplitude jumps and brief irregular oscillations in the first ~0.1â€“0.12 s across multiple leads, followed immediately by a prolonged period of flat zero values (complete loss of signal) for the remainder of the recording; the early segment demonstrates rapid baseline shifts and abrupt transient deflections rather than a smooth physiologic rhythm, consistent with intermittent bursts of electrical interference superimposed on the cardiac signal, and the abrupt transition to long stretches of zero output is characteristic of electrode disconnection or lead artifact; there is also evidence of low-frequency movement of the baseline in the initial waveform (baseline wander) and short-duration high-amplitude spikes/bursts (burst/static noise) rather than organized pacemaker pacing spikes. Final answer: baseline drift (baseline wander), static (high-frequency) noise / burst noise, and electrode artifacts (lead/electrode disconnection).
