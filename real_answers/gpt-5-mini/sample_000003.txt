The available recording is severely degraded with baseline wander, static and burst noise and extensive artifact that limits interpretation, but the brief nonzero segment at the start shows uniform lead deflections with what appears to be an electrically paced morphology (consistent sharp initial deflection/pacing artifact and broad abnormal QRS-like deflection) rather than discrete, localized ST-segment elevation or pathologic Q-waves typical of acute myocardial infarction; there are no clear reciprocal ST depressions or evolving T-wave changes in the visible samples, and the remainder of the trace is essentially flat/zeroed suggesting recording/electrode failure rather than ongoing ischemic evolutionâ€”given the documented pacemaker, pacing-related wide QRS/conduction abnormalities are the prominent feature and a conduction disturbance.
