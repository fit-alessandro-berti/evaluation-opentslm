The recording segment is severely limited and degraded: after approximately 0.12 s of usable signal the entire 10‑s trace is zeroed, and the available leads show baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact which confound morphology; a pacemaker is documented and pacing artifacts can mimic or obscure native beats. In the short visible window there is a single large, predominantly positive deflection in the precordial leads around 0.02 s with a rapid return toward baseline and a subsequent smaller positive/negative deflection by 0.06–0.10 s, but there is no clear sequence of sinus P waves, consistent PR intervals, coupling intervals or a regular baseline rhythm from which a premature beat could be confidently identified or classified (and pacemaker spikes could account for some abnormalities). Because of the brief, noisy, artifact‑contaminated sample and the pacemaker presence it is not possible to verify the timing and morphology required to label a beat as a premature atrial or ventricular extrasystole. Final answer: No clear extra systoles can be identified in the available ECG segment (insufficient/poor-quality data to confirm).
