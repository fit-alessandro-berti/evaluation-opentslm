The strip shows only a very brief, noisy epoch (one apparent beat around 0.02–0.10 s) with substantial baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats and a known pacemaker which together severely limit reliable interpretation; the waveform captured has a rapid positive QRS-like deflection (peaking ~0.06 s) followed by negative deflection but there is no clear, sustained ST-segment elevation above an identifiable stable baseline, no obvious new pathological Q wave pattern, and T-wave morphology is difficult to assess given post‑QRS baseline deviation and marked data dropout for the remainder of the recording, so the tracing does not demonstrate the customary, reproducible electrocardiographic features expected for the middle (evolving/subacute) stage of myocardial infarction. Final answer: No.
