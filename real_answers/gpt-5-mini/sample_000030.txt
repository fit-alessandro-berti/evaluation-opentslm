The recorded traces are limited and noisy but the initial nonzero segment shows abrupt, high-frequency deflections and rapid changes in baseline with repetitive sharp events before or within the ventricular complexes, consistent with pacemaker artefact in a paced rhythm; signal quality issues (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artefact) and the abrupt truncation of data limit precise measurements of PR/QRS/QT intervals and true beat-to-beat timing, however the presence of pacing-related spikes and the metadata noting extra beats imply rhythm disturbance (ectopy/paced beats) rather than a perfectly intrinsic sinus rhythm â€” therefore, yes.
