The trace shows a few brief physiologic-looking deflections in the first ~0.12 seconds across multiple leads (small-amplitude wandering baseline and transient negative/positive excursions) followed by an abrupt and persistent return to exact zero values for the remainder of the recording, which is not physiologic and indicates major signal dropout or lead/electrode disconnection; within the initial segment there are sudden large sample-to-sample changes (for example the negative spike around 0.04 s) and short-lived irregularities that are consistent with burst noise or transient static, and the slow shifts of the baseline level before the dropout are compatible with baseline drift; because the recording becomes exactly flat after 0.12 s no reliable measurement of intervals or repeatable QRS/pacing spikes can be made, so pacemaker spikes cannot be confidently identified on this data despite the clinical note of a pacemaker. Final answer: Yes â€” the ECG contains baseline drift, static/burst noise and clear electrode/signal dropout (electrode artifact/lead-off); pacemaker-related interference is noted in the clinical context but is not clearly demonstrable in this recording.
