The tracing as provided contains only a very brief non‑zero segment (roughly the first 0.12 s) with a single complex-like waveform and then essentially flat/zero data for the remainder of the recording, together with noted baseline drift, noise and electrode artifact and a documented pacemaker; because supraventricular extrasystoles are diagnosed by observing premature P‑waves (or premature narrow QRS complexes with preserved morphology compared with sinus beats), their timing relative to preceding beats, and any compensatory pause, none of which can be assessed when only a single beat (and noisy/paced signals) is present, there is insufficient morphological or interval information (no reproducible premature P wave, no sequence of beats to show prematurity or coupling intervals, and pacemaker artefact further confounds interpretation) to demonstrate SV extrasystoles; therefore, based on this recording, supraventricular extrasystoles are not seen.
