The raw traces show brief, rapidly changing, high-amplitude deflections confined to very short time windows and a sharp, near-simultaneous voltage blip across many leads at ~0.06 s consistent with a pacemaker stimulus; because the recording sampling rate is 100 Hz (10 ms/sample) I estimated QRS events by counting samples from initial rapid departure from baseline to return. The first spontaneous complex around 0.00–0.05 s spans roughly 4–5 samples (~40–50 ms) and the later event after the pacing artifact (peak at ~0.10–0.11 s) returns to baseline by ~0.12 s, spanning only ~2–3 samples (~20–30 ms); despite baseline drift and artifact the ventricular depolarizations are very narrow on this trace, well below the 120 ms threshold for a wide QRS. Final answer: within the normal range.
