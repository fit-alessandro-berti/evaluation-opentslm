The V1 trace shows normal-looking rapid deflections only in the very first ~0.11 seconds but then abruptly becomes an exact zero baseline for the remainder of the recording (every sample from 0.12 s onward is 0.00000), a pattern incompatible with physiologic cardiac signals and inconsistent with low‑frequency baseline wander, intermittent burst noise, or myopotential static noise; this abrupt loss of signal with a persistent flatline is characteristic of an electrode/lead disconnection or lead‑off type artifact. Final answer: electrode (lead‑off) artifact.
