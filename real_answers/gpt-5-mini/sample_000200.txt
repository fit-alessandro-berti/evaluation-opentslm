On inspection of the provided time series there is very limited usable ECG data (non-zero waveform only for roughly the first 0.12 s) with marked baseline drift, noise and electrode artifact and a pacemaker noted, which substantially limits assessment; within the short segment available I see transient deflections across the leads consistent with a single complex but no clear sequence of normal sinus P–QRS–T cycles, no reproducible premature complexes with wide QRS morphology or absence of preceding P waves, and no obvious compensatory pause characteristic of ventricular extrasystoles; pacemaker activity is not clearly visualized as discrete pacing spikes and the trace is otherwise truncated to zeros for the remainder of the recording so any intermittent ventricular ectopy could easily be missed. Final answer: No — ventricular extrasystoles are not evident on the provided recording (assessment limited by poor signal quality and truncated data).
