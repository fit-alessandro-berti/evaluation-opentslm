On inspection the tracings are limited to the first ~0.12 seconds of data with the rest of the recording effectively flatlined at zero and multiple quality problems recorded (baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact) so the morphology is fragmentary and contaminated; there are short high-amplitude deflections in some precordial leads and likely pacing-related signals and extra beats are noted, but there are no clearly delineated consecutive cardiac cycles from which to measure stable RR intervals, a PR interval, QRS duration or QT interval with confidence, and the presence of pacemaker spikes and electrode/signal dropout further confound interval measurement and axis/morphology assessment. Because of the limited duration of usable signal, marked noise and pacing/artefact, standard numeric ECG features (heart rate/RR, PR, QRS, QT/QTc) cannot be reliably measured or confirmed to be within normal limits. Final answer: none of the numeric ECG features can be confidently declared within the normal range from this recording.
