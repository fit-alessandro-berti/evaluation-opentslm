On careful inspection of the V3 time series, the lead shows brief, large-amplitude, rapid fluctuations limited to the first ~0.11–0.12 seconds (examples: small negative deflections at 0.00–0.02 s, a positive deflection near 0.03 s, a large positive around 0.06 s ~1.42 units followed immediately by a large negative at 0.07 s ~‑2.04 units, then further irregular swings through 0.11 s) followed by an extended period of zero-valued samples for the remainder of the recording; these findings are most consistent with transient high-amplitude artifacts, possible pacing-related spikes and eventual data drop-out rather than a slow, low-frequency wandering baseline; because baseline drift is characterized by a gradual, low-frequency wander of the isoelectric line over seconds across the recording and here the signal shows abrupt jumps/noise and a flat zeroed segment that preclude assessment of a gradual baseline wander, the V3 trace does not demonstrate true baseline drift. No.
