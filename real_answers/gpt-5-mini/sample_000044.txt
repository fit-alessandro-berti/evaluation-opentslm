The tracing quality is poor and largely limited to a brief initial window (signals present only to ~0.11–0.12 s with the remainder effectively flat), with baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefact noted and a pacemaker reported; these factors make clear evaluation of ST segments and T waves unreliable. Morphologically the only measurable event is a rapid deflection cluster in the first 100–120 ms consistent with a paced or intrinsically wide QRS complex rather than a clear isoelectric ST segment followed by distinct T-wave morphology; there are no reproducible ST-elevations or depressions or consistent T-wave inversions that can be reliably measured given the truncation and noise, while the QRS appearance and the clinical note of a pacemaker point toward bundle-branch–type or paced conduction abnormality. Conclusion: conduction disturbance.
