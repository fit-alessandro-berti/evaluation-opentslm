The short available waveform shows large, simultaneous deflections across multiple leads in the initial ~0.00â€“0.11 s window followed by a long region of zeroed signal, with documented baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact; these features are non-physiologic and consistent with device/pacing artifact or recording contamination rather than clearly formed, repeatable P waves and QRS complexes, and the abrupt disappearance of signal after 0.12 s indicates data dropout making sequential rhythm analysis impossible; although a pacemaker is noted and transient high-amplitude, narrow deflections could represent pacing spikes, there are no consecutive, interpretable QRS complexes to measure rate, regularity, or conduction intervals, and the reported "extra beats detected" may reflect noise or sporadic ectopy but cannot be confirmed from this trace. Final answer: Pacemaker artifact present and the tracing is nondiagnostic for underlying rhythm (unable to determine actual cardiac rhythm due to heavy noise and signal dropout).
