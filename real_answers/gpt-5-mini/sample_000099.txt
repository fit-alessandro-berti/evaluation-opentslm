The tracing shows marked signal instability and artifact rather than clear cardiac morphology: after about 0.12 s the channels are essentially flatlined (zeros), and in the initial sampled segment there are large, irregular, high-amplitude, nonphysiologic fluctuations consistent with static/interference noise rather than true QRS/T waves; the precordial channel V1 demonstrates the largest abrupt excursions (e.g., values to ≈ -5.3 mV) with similar high-amplitude jagged deflections in V2, and the augmented limb lead aVL also shows large, nonphysiologic swings (±4–5 mV) while the remaining leads show smaller, more physiological-looking amplitudes or duplicated signals (I and II are identical, suggesting lead derivation issues). Answer: aVL, V1 and V2.
