The short sampled portion of this tracing in lead V4 shows multiple rapid deflections and high-amplitude swings early (notably positive peaks around 0.06–0.11 s) but the recording then becomes zeroed-out for the remainder of the strip, and the clinical header documents baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats and a pacemaker—all of which distort morphology; physiologically the T wave normally occurs well after the QRS (typically >100–200 ms after the QRS upstroke), but the available nonzero data ends by ~110 ms and thus likely does not capture the true repolarization phase for a complete beat, so any apparent polarity changes in the tiny captured window are unreliable. Final answer: No — an inverted T wave in lead V4 cannot be confirmed from this recording (insufficient/poor-quality data).
