The tracing shows a single clear ventricular complex in the first 0.12 seconds with high-amplitude rapid deflections across the precordial leads despite baseline wander and artifact; with a sampling rate of 100 Hz (10 ms resolution) the major rapid deflection begins around 30–40 ms (first consistent departure from baseline/previous small deflections) reaches its peak at about 60–80 ms and returns essentially to baseline by approximately 110 ms, and this morphology (sharp, relatively brief depolarization across multiple leads) argues against a markedly prolonged or bundle-branch–type wide QRS despite the presence of a pacemaker spike and noise which could confound exact edges — given the timepoints above the QRS spans on the order of a few dozen milliseconds rather than over 120 ms. Final answer: QRS duration ≈ 80–100 ms.
