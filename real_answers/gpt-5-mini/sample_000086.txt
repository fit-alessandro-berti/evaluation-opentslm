The recorded traces show brief, high-amplitude, rapidly changing deflections across multiple leads in the first ~0.00â€“0.11 s, including abrupt polarity changes and sharp transitions, followed by an abrupt and sustained collapse of the signal to a constant zero level across all leads from ~0.12 s onward; there is no slow, low-frequency wander of the isoelectric line over time but rather sudden step-like changes and a prolonged flatline (suggesting lead disconnection/clip or burst artifact), and the morphology and intervals cannot be reliably measured because the tracing is interrupted by these abrupt artifacts rather than showing progressive baseline wandering as would be expected with respiration- or movement-related drift. Final answer: static noise.
