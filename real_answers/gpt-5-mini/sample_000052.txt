The available recording is fragmentary and heavily affected by noise and artifact: only a brief epoch at the start (roughly the first 0.10–0.12 s) contains cardiac signal while the remainder of the trace appears flattened to zero, and the header notes baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats and a pacemaker—all of which impair reliable morphology assessment. In the brief usable segment limb lead polarities are inconsistent (some early samples show negative deflections in I and aVF, other samples show positive peaks), and there are no clear, repeated clean QRS complexes from which to measure QRS frontal plane mean vector or to apply standard axis rules (e.g., lead I and aVF net QRS polarity). Paced ventriculo‑atrial morphology can also alter the apparent axis. Because of the truncated, noisy signal and pacing/artefact contamination, a dependable QRS axis calculation cannot be made and the presence of an extreme (northwest) axis cannot be confirmed. Final answer: Cannot be determined from this recording.
