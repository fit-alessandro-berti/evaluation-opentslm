The available recording contains only a very brief segment of nonzero waveform (~0â€“0.11 s) followed by essentially flat/zero data for the remainder, and the trace is affected by baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact with a pacemaker noted; within that short window there are no clearly identifiable, complete cardiac cycles with distinct P waves, consistent PR intervals or full narrow QRS complexes to assess prematurity or morphology, and any pacemaker spikes or flagged "extra beats" cannot be reliably distinguished from artifact in the truncated signal, so criteria used to diagnose supraventricular extrasystoles (premature P before a narrow QRS with characteristic coupling and compensatory pause) cannot be applied. Final answer: Cannot be determined from this recording (insufficient/poor-quality data to confirm supraventricular extrasystoles).
