The tracing is noisy and influenced by baseline wander, electrode artifact and a pacemaker which complicate interpretation, but focussing on frontal-plane limb-lead QRS polarity and the clear precordial pattern provides guidance: the limb leads (I, II, III, aVL, aVF) show low-amplitude and variable deflections without the consistent pattern expected for true left-axis deviation (classically a clearly positive I with clearly negative aVF and often negative II), while the precordial leads (notably tall R waves in V4â€“V5) indicate dominant leftward ventricular forces; because the frontal-plane leads do not demonstrate the definitive I-positive / aVF-negative pattern of LAD and instead are near isoelectric/variable (likely affected by pacemaker-related and recording artifacts), the overall data are most consistent with a normal heart axis. Final answer: Normal heart axis.
