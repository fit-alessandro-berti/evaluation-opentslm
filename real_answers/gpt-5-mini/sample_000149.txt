The available recording is severely limited by noise, electrode artifact and extensive dropout (meaning usable signal is present only in the first ~0.11–0.12 s of the 10 s file), and a pacemaker is documented; in the visible segment there appears to be a single abrupt high‑amplitude biphasic complex but no sequence of sinus beats with a premature, wide QRS lacking an antecedent P wave that would characterize ventricular extrasystoles, and pacemaker spikes or artifact can mimic or obscure ventricular complexes; because the tracing is truncated, noisy and dominated by a single captured complex it is not possible to identify premature isolated or repetitive ventricular ectopy with confidence, and the morphology is more suggestive of a paced/artefactual complex than clear PVCs. Final answer: No.
