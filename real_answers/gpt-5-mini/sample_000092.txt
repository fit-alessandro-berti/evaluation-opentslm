The tracing contains heavy artifact and pacemaker activity and shows only a brief burst of cardiac signal in the first ~0.1â€“0.12 seconds with a single obvious QRS-like deflection around 0.09 s (and no successive full cardiac cycles visible afterward because the remainder of the recording is zeroed), so there are not two successive R-waves available to calculate an RR interval; with baseline wander, static/burst noise and electrode artifact present and pacemaker influence, heart rate/ RR variability cannot be reliably measured from this file, so it is not possible to demonstrate an RR interval below the normal range from the provided data. Answer: Cannot determine.
