The trace in V2 shows short-duration physiologic-looking variability in the first ~0.12 seconds (sharp deflections and amplitude changes paralleling other leads), followed by an abrupt and persistent return to exact zero values for the remainder of the recording, which is not consistent with a true cardiac signal; the early portion also contains abrupt large-amplitude jumps suggestive of burst/static noise or artifact rather than clean ECG morphology, and the sudden step to a flat zero trace is most consistent with electrode/lead disconnect or signal dropout (an electrode artifact/flatline) rather than a physiologic change. Yes.
