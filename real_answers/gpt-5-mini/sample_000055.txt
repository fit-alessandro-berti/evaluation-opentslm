The trace shows a normal-looking multi-lead ECG pattern only in the first ~0.12 seconds with clear beat-to-beat morphology across leads, then an abrupt, simultaneous collapse of all lead signals to exact zeros for the remainder of the recording; this sudden, brief-period disruption with complete loss of signal across leads is inconsistent with the slow, low-frequency wandering of the ECG baseline that characterizes baseline drift and instead reflects a transient, high-amplitude interruption or dropout of the recorded signal (an intermittent artifact/burst), so this ECG demonstrates burst noise.
