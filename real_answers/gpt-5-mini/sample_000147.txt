The tracing shows a single clear cardiac cycle in the early portion of the recording followed by prolonged loss of signal and marked artifact, so interpretation is constrained by poor signal quality, baseline drift and electrode/static noise; morphologically there is a very large, predominantly negative, rapid deflection across the precordial and limb leads (notably in V1–V3 and in many limb leads) with preceding small sharp deflections in some leads that could represent pacemaker stimulus artifacts, and the QRS-like deflection appears abrupt and relatively large in amplitude suggesting a paced ventricular complex rather than native narrow-complex conduction; there are also irregular extra beats/artifacts indicated in the recording that may represent ventricular ectopy or sensing/lead noise; ST–T analysis is not reliable given the short usable segment and noise. Final interpretation: ventricular paced rhythm with paced (wide) ventricular complexes and apparent pacemaker spike(s); possible ventricular extrasystoles/ectopy noted; assessment of ischemic ST–T changes or the native conduction pattern is uncertain because of marked noise and recording dropout.
