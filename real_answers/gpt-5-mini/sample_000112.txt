The tracing shows clear non-physiologic, high-amplitude irregular fluctuations and abrupt baseline disturbances affecting both the limb and precordial channels: within the first ~0.1 s many leads (limb leads I, II, III and augmented leads aVR, aVL, aVF) and the precordial leads (V1â€“V6) demonstrate large, inconsistent deflections and correlated artifact (for example I and II are identical for several samples, a sign of lead/recording artifact), followed by a prolonged period of flatlined zeros consistent with lead/equipment dropout; these findings indicate widespread electrical/static interference rather than an isolated lead problem. Final answer: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6.
