The available recording shows only a very brief segment of cardiac activity (roughly the first 0.11 s) with subsequent data truncated to zeros and multiple quality issues noted (baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact) and a pacemaker noted in the clinical context; within the visible segment I can see rapid deflections but I cannot clearly and reliably identify the onset of a QRS, the offset of the T wave, or an RR interval needed to calculate an absolute or rate-corrected QT; pacemaker-related signals and the extra-beat/artifact contamination further confound delineation of native ventricular depolarization and repolarization intervals. Conclusion: it is not possible to determine from this recording whether the QT interval is above the normal range.
