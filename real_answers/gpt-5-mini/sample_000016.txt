The provided time series is severely limited: after about 0.12 seconds (only ~12 samples at 100 Hz) the tracings for all leads are flatlined at zero for the remainder of the 10 s recording and the header notes baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifacts and a pacemaker presence, so there are only a few milliseconds of waveform data to examine and no continuous sequences of P‑QRS‑T complexes to allow rhythm analysis; the short initial segment does not show identifiable, repeatable P waves followed by narrow QRS complexes or premature complexes with the expected morphology and timing needed to call supraventricular extrasystoles, and pacing/artefact could further obscure or mimic any ectopy. Final answer: cannot be determined from this recording (no reliable evidence of supraventricular extrasystoles).
