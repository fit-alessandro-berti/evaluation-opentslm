The available tracing shows a single clear cardiac complex in the first ~0.03–0.06 s window with signal quality issues and many later samples zeroed, but the QRS of that beat is predominantly positive in the frontal-plane limb leads: lead I shows a large positive deflection around 0.03 s and the inferior leads (II and aVF) are also positive at the same time, while precordial leads V3–V6 are positive, indicating an overall mean QRS vector directed inferiorly and leftward; there are baseline and electrode artifacts and a limited sampling of a single beat so interval measurements are approximate, but the frontal-plane polarity pattern (I positive, aVF positive) is most consistent with a normal mean electrical axis. Final answer: normal axis.
