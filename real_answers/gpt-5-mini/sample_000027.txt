The recording shows a paced ventricular complex with relatively large, broad monophasic/positive deflections across the limb and precordial leads rather than the characteristic rSR' pattern in V1 or terminal R' of right bundle branch block; the precordial leads do not demonstrate the typical tall R' in V1 with a delayed terminal positivity and there is a diffuse, broad-looking QRS morphology with associated baseline/pacing artifact that is more consistent with a left-sided conduction delay produced by ventricular pacing; given the presence of a pacemaker, the morphology across V1â€“V6 and the absence of the classic RBBB features argue against an incomplete RBBB and instead favor a left bundle-branch conduction pattern. Answer: complete left bundle branch block.
