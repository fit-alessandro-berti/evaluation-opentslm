The recording shows only a very brief epoch of cardiac-like activity in the first ~0.1–0.12 s across all 12 leads followed by an essentially flat trace (zeros) for the remainder of the 10 s record, which is not physiologic and indicates major data dropout or lead/equipment failure; the early segment shows large, asynchronous deflections in the precordial leads and near-identical values in limb leads I/II/III (which is unlikely for a normal 12-lead ECG and suggests lead misplacement, channel duplication, or artifact), and the header notes baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifacts, extra beats detected and a pacemaker present — all of which confound accurate interval and waveform measurement (no reliable PR, QRS duration, QT or consistent P waves can be measured across multiple beats). Given the short, noisy, nonrepresentative sample, evidence of recording artifacts and signal loss, and the inability to confirm normal sinus morphology and intervals, this is not a normal ECG. No.
