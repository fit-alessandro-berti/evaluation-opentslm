The recorded signal (100 Hz sampling) shows identifiable atrial activity in lead II as a small, low-amplitude deflection that begins just after 0.00–0.01 s and resolves before the large QRS-like deflection at ~0.07 s; despite baseline drift, noise and artifact warnings and the presence of a pacemaker, the putative P-wave spans only about 4–5 samples (≈40–50 ms) from initial deviation to return to baseline, which is well below the commonly used upper limit of normal (~120 ms), so the P-wave duration falls within the normal range. Final answer: within the normal range.
