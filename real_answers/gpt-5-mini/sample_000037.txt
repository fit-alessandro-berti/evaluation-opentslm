I examined the V4 time series point-by-point: the first 0.00–0.11 s contains physiologic-looking deflections with QRS-sized negative excursions (about −0.8 to −1.8 mV) and gradual changes consistent with baseline wander, but beginning at 0.12 s the trace is uniformly zero for the remainder of the recording, indicating abrupt signal dropout or lead disconnect rather than intermittent high-frequency transient disturbances; burst noise would be expected as short, irregular, high‑frequency spikes or bursts superimposed on an otherwise continuous trace, which are not seen in V4 (the early segment shows no sharp, repeated high‑frequency spikes and the dominant abnormality is an abrupt loss of signal). Final answer: No — lead V4 does not demonstrate burst noise (it shows an abrupt signal loss/flatline artifact).
