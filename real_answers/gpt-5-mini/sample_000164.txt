The aVF trace shows physiologic-looking deflections in the first 0.11 s but then an abrupt loss of signal (drop to zero) and intermittent large transient excursions rather than a slow, low‑frequency wander or continuous high‑frequency jitter; these features are most consistent with sudden electrode/signal artifact and short bursts of noise (burst/intermittent artifact), whereas there is no sustained high‑frequency static/myopotential noise or clear narrow pacemaker spikes in the aVF channel. Final answer: electrode artifact and burst noise.
