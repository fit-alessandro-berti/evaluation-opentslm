The available recording segment is very short and abruptly truncated with widespread zeros, and there is marked baseline wander and electrode/static artifacts, but in the initial preserved seconds there are abrupt, very narrow, high‑amplitude deflections nearly simultaneous in all leads followed by QRS‑like waveforms, consistent with pacing spikes and subsequent ventricular capture; the pattern of paced complexes appears to be the dominant rhythm in the sampled portion, and there are additional early, non‑sinus beats (extra premature complexes) evident relative to the paced rhythm. Final answer: Ventricular paced rhythm with premature ventricular extra beats (PVCs) present.
