The recording shows an initial short burst of high-amplitude deflections across the limb and precordial leads in the first ~0.11 s followed by abrupt flattening to zero for the remainder of the file, and the provided metadata documents baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats detected and a pacemaker; because of the very limited nonzero segment and obvious data dropout I cannot reliably measure PR, QRS or QT intervals or evaluate ST segments or repolarization, and the baseline/artifact make waveform morphology and timing uncertain, though the early complexes appear large and somewhat atypical and the presence of a pacemaker and reported extra beats indicate underlying rhythm abnormalities; given these findings the tracing is technically abnormal/unreadable for diagnostic interpretation and should be repeated with careful electrode placement and noise reduction. Final answer: Yes — the ECG recording is abnormal (pacemaker present, extra beats reported) but is non‑diagnostic due to heavy artifacts and data dropout, so a repeat high-quality 12‑lead ECG is required.
