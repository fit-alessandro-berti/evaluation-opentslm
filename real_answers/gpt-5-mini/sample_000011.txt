The short segment of usable data shows predominantly positive QRS deflections in the frontal plane leads (notably I and II and aVF) and large positive precordial deflections, and despite marked baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacemaker being present, the dominant QRS polarity in the limb leads is toward the left/inferior leads rather than away from them; physiologically a normal (leftward/inferior) mean QRS vector is suggested when leads I and aVF (and II) are positive. There are recording artifacts and intervals are difficult to measure reliably from the truncated/zeroed data, and aVR shows atypical values which could reflect lead placement/pacing or artifact rather than a true northwest axis; overall the frontal plane polarity pattern is not consistent with extreme (northwest) axis deviation, which would show negative I and negative aVF. Final answer: normal heart axis.
