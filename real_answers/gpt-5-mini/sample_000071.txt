The limb-lead QRS polarities and amplitudes show predominantly positive QRS complexes in leads I, II and III with aVF also positive while aVR is less negative than expected, and the precordial leads are positive as well, consistent with an inferior-directed mean QRS vector; using lead I (≈ +4.3) and aVF (≈ +2.4) the approximate frontal plane axis = arctan(aVF/I) ≈ +30°, which falls within the normal frontal plane range and argues against classical left or right axis deviation (noting the tracing is noisy and a pacemaker and artifact are present, which can alter morphology). Final answer: Normal (approximately +30°).
