The tracing is noisy and limited (baseline wander, electrode/static artifacts and pacing noted, with most of the recording truncated to the initial beat), but focusing on the visible beat the QRS complex is followed by a clearly negative repolarisation deflection in several leads rather than a shallow, horizontal depression of the ST segment: the post‑QRS waveform in the limb and anterior leads goes below the baseline in the expected T‑wave time window, with relatively sharp negative polarity consistent with inverted T waves rather than a diffuse, non‑specific ST‑segment downshift. Final answer: inverted t‑waves.
