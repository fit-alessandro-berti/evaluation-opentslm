Reviewing the recorded tracings (noting baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and a known pacemaker), I looked for QRS/R wave peaks in the available nonzero segment: there is a clear large positive deflection in the limb leads at about 0.03 s and a subsequent prominent deflection at about 0.11 s, giving an inter-beat interval on the order of 0.08 s (≈80 ms); even allowing for some timing uncertainty from noise or pacing artifacts, this interval is an order of magnitude shorter than the normal RR interval (normally ~600–1000 ms for sinus rhythm), so the measured RR interval is below the normal range.
