Initial inspection of the available signal shows large QRS-related deflections with a baseline that is negative at the start (limb leads I/II/III ≈ -0.13 mV, precordials V4–V6 ≈ -0.10 to -0.06 mV at t=0) followed by positive post‑QRS values in the interval interpreted as the ST segment (around t≈0.09 s) with leads II, III and aVF rising to ~0.21–0.43 mV and lateral precordial leads V4–V6 also elevated (~0.19–0.27 mV) compared with the pre‑beat baseline, consistent with ST‑segment elevation in the inferior and lateral leads; aVR remains low, which can serve as a reciprocal reference. There are prominent QRS amplitude changes and noisy/artefactual portions (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacemaker noted) that limit precise measurement of J‑point offsets and make magnitude estimates approximate, and intervals (PR, QRS, QT) cannot be accurately delineated from the truncated/noisy trace. The pattern of ST elevation localized to the inferior and lateral leads (with relative reciprocal negativity in anterior/rightward leads) favors a transmural infarction affecting inferoposterolateral territories rather than diffuse subendocardial ischemia, though interpretation is qualified by the signal quality and presence of pacing/artefact. Final answer: myocardial infarction in inferoposterolateral leads.
