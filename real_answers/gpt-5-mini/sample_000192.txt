Reviewing the available tracings and despite the significant baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact and the presence of pacing/extra-beat activity that limit certainty, the dominant QRS deflection in the limb leads is positive: lead I shows a large positive deflection (peak around 0.04 s) and the inferior lead aVF shows a concordant positive deflection during that same QRS complex, which indicates an electrical mean vector directed inferiorly and leftward within the expected physiological range; since the key leads used to estimate frontal plane axis (I and aVF) are both predominantly positive the frontal QRS axis lies between roughly −30° and +90° consistent with a normal axis. Yes.
