The strip as provided contains only a single clearly deflected cardiac complex early in the file (roughly 0.09–0.11 s) with the remainder of the trace zeroed out and multiple signal-quality warnings (baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact, extra beats and a pacemaker), so precise interval measurement is not possible; nevertheless inspection of the available waveform shows a prominent, brief paced/ventricular-looking QRS complex with no obvious prolonged ST‑segment elevation or markedly delayed T‑wave offset and no evidence of clearly prolonged repolarization on the visible beat — acknowledging that pacemaker morphology and the limited, noisy sample can both falsely shorten or prolong apparent QT, the data that are present do not show features of QT prolongation and are most consistent with a QTc falling within the normal range. Answer: within the normal range.
