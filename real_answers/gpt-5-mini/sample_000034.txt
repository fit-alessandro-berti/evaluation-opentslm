The tracing is limited by marked baseline wander and multiple artifacts and a pacemaker, but evaluating the recorded complexes and ST relationships stepwise shows the most pronounced abnormality in the anterior/precordial leads: the precordial leads (V1–V3) move from negative deflections into prominent positive complexes with apparent upward shift of the ST/early repolarization area compared with the limb leads, whereas the inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5–V6) do not show definitive concordant ST elevation and instead are less striking and variably noisy; the presence of pacing and noise can distort QRS and ST morphology and produce pseudo-elevations or depressions, and there are extra beats and artifact that limit precise interval measurements, but the dominant pattern—larger amplitude changes localized to the anteroseptal chest leads despite signal quality limitations—is most consistent with an anteroseptal myocardial infarction (interpretation limited/uncertain due to pacing and artifact). Final answer: myocardial infarction in anteroseptal leads (probable, interpretation uncertain).
