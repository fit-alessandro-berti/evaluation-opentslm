Examining the V4 time series shows rapid, irregular sample-to-sample fluctuations and abrupt amplitude jumps over tens of milliseconds rather than a slow, smooth wandering of the baseline; the typical P‑QRS‑T morphology is obscured by these high‑frequency, jagged changes so that intervals cannot be reliably measured in this segment, and the pattern is more consistent with electrode/static interference (and there is a later abrupt data dropout to zero values consistent with electrode artifact), whereas true baseline drift would present as a low‑frequency, gradual baseline wander over seconds; therefore, this lead shows static noise. Final answer: static noise.
