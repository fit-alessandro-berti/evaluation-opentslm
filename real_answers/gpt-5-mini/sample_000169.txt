The recorded tracing shows brief varying waveforms in the first ~0.12 s across multiple channels with some identical/repeated values between leads (suggesting channel coupling or artifact) followed immediately by a prolonged segment of complete flat (zero) signals for all channels for the remainder of the recording, consistent with major signal dropout/overwhelming nonphysiologic interference rather than isolated lead changes; given the uniform nature of the artifact after the initial segment and the presence of electrode/pacing and static noise flags in the record, the static noise affects all leads â€” I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6.
