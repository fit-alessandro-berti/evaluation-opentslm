The strip contains only a single clear complex (prominent precordial deflection around 0.00–0.05 s) with the remainder of the recording truncated to zeros and significant noise/artifact noted, so there is insufficient continuous tracings to demonstrate alternating paired beats; no discrete premature complexes with consistent short coupling intervals or an alternating normal–premature pattern are visible, P waves are not clearly resolved and there are pacing/electrode artifacts that further limit interpretation, but the available beat appears isolated and not part of a repetitive bigeminal sequence; therefore the rhythm is best characterized as sinus rhythm.
