The recorded traces show only a very brief segment of a single complex with significant baseline wander, static/burst noise and obvious pacing artifact (large sharp deflections in the lateral precordial leads at ~0.06–0.07 s) that distort the QRS and ST/T regions; the QRS morphology appears paced/wide and the following ST/T portions vary between isoelectric and mildly deviated across leads without a clear, concordant horizontal or downsloping shift of the ST segment in multiple contiguous leads; given the heavy artifact and paced complexes the ST deviations are small, inconsistent and not a clear focal ST depression pattern, therefore this ECG is best described as showing non‑specific ST changes. Final answer: non-specific ST changes.
