The available tracing shows isolated early beats with QRS complexes that have a markedly different and more ventricular-looking morphology in the chest leads (large, predominantly negative deflections in V1–V3) compared with the preceding complexes, there are no clear preceding P waves before these ectopic complexes, the QRS/T polarity is discordant relative to the baseline beats, and the ectopic complexes interrupt the rhythm with a pause pattern consistent with a compensatory pause; although there is baseline noise and a pacemaker artifact that could confound interpretation, the combination of an altered, broad-appearing QRS morphology localized to the precordial leads and absence of an antecedent P wave strongly favors a ventricular origin for the extrasystoles — ventricular extrasystoles.
