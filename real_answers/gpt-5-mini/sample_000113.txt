The recorded trace in lead III begins with a small positive deflection followed rapidly by a large negative deflection and a prolonged negative excursion before returning toward baseline, but the recording is limited by baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact and truncation of the trace so intervals are difficult to measure precisely; the morphology shows an initial tiny r-like positive upstroke at the very start (≈0.00 s) then a large, deep negative deflection (peaking around 0.08–0.09 s) without a subsequent prominent positive R', consistent with a predominantly negative QRS complex. Taken together (small initial positive then major negative deflection), lead III demonstrates an rS-type pattern — in other words a dominant S-wave/predominantly negative QRS (rS morphology) in lead III.
