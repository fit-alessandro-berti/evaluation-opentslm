I inspected the recorded beats (noting baseline drift, noise and pacemaker activity) in the early portion of the trace where QRS complexes are present and found markedly large QRS amplitudes in the lateral precordial leads: V6 shows the largest positive excursion (peak ~7.45 mV) and V5 reaches ~3.50 mV, while V1 has a modest negative deflection (S ≈ 1.2–1.3 mV). Using standard voltage criteria, S in V1 plus R in V5 or V6 well exceeds the Sokolow–Lyon threshold (3.5 mV), and R in aVL (~2.19 mV) combined with the S in V3/V1 also exceeds the Cornell threshold for women; therefore the leads meeting voltage criteria for LVH in this ECG are V5 and V6 (with aVL also satisfying Cornell criteria).
