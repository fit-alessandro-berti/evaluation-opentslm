The tracing shows an abrupt, early beat that interrupts the regular rhythm: it occurs prematurely relative to the preceding cycle, is followed by a compensatory pause, and the QRS-like deflection is broad and bizarre in morphology across the limb and precordial leads without a clear preceding P-wave; although the record notes a pacemaker, the premature complex does not have a discrete pacing spike immediately before it and its wide, abnormal QRS morphology (discordant from the conducted beats) favors an origin below the AV node in the ventricles rather than an atrial or junctional premature focus. Final answer: ventricular premature complex (PVC).
