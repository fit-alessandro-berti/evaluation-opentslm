The available signal in lead V2 is limited to the first ~0.11 s of the recording with the remainder of the file zeroed out and with baseline drift and electrode/static noise noted, so interpretation is constrained; within that early segment V2 demonstrates rapid, high-amplitude deflections with large initial negative excursions (around -0.8 to -1.0 units) interspersed with brief positive blips and no clear preceding P waves or normal narrow QRS morphology, suggesting electrically delivered artifacts followed by wide, predominantly negative ventricular complexes rather than native narrow-complex beats. Taken together — given the recorded presence of a pacemaker and the abrupt, brief spike-like activity immediately before broad negative complexes in V2 — the morphology is most consistent with ventricular paced complexes (paced rhythm with QS-like QRS in V2).
