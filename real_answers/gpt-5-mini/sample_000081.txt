The available trace is limited to the first ~0.12 seconds of the recording and is affected by baseline wander, static and electrode artifact as noted, but within that window there is a single rapid biphasic deflection pattern (a sharp positive deflection around 20â€“30 ms followed by a negative swing) seen across multiple leads consistent with one QRS complex or a paced complex rather than two discrete, separate premature complexes; there are no clearly separate premature P waves preceding an early narrow QRS that would suggest PACs, nor is there a separate, markedly wide and bizarre QRS occurring earlier than expected that would indicate a PVC, and because the remainder of the recording is all zeros in the provided dataset and the pacemaker and noise can mimic or obscure small events, a definitive identification of extras is limited by the truncated data and artifact. Final answer: No clear extra systoles identified in the provided segment.
