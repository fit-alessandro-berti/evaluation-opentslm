The tracing is very limited and heavily artifacted with most of the recording zeroed out after ~0.12 s, but examining the initial segment shows abrupt, high‑amplitude, simultaneous sharp deflections across multiple leads at ~0.10 s consistent with an electrical pacing stimulus followed by a depolarization‑like waveform, while baseline wander, static/burst noise and electrode artifact and the truncated recording make assessment of QRS morphology, intervals, ischemic ST‑T changes or arrhythmia unreliable; therefore the only diagnostic feature that can be stated with confidence is implanted pacemaker activity with paced beats, and no other specific diagnostic abnormalities can be confirmed. Final answer: Yes — clear pacemaker spikes with paced complexes are present (otherwise the ECG is largely uninterpretable).
