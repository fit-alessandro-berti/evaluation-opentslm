The recording shows a very noisy, artifact-laden tracing with baseline wander, static/burst noise and pacemaker activity that obscure the repolarization segments and make T-wave morphology unreliable on many leads; over the measurable interval there are abrupt large deflections and inconsistent baselines so that T-wave polarity and symmetry cannot be confidently assessed in the limb and lateral precordial leads, with the most pronounced distortion and inconsistent T-wave appearance seen in the lateral leads (I and aVL) and the lateral precordial leads (V5â€“V6) and also affecting lead II, so these leads demonstrate non-diagnostic T-wave abnormalities. Final answer: I, II, aVL, V5, V6.
