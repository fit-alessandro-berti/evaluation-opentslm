The recording shows a single clear cardiac complex early in the tracing with substantial baseline wander and noise, but inspection of the main QRS moment (around 0.02–0.04 s) demonstrates predominantly positive QRS deflections in the limb leads (I, II, III) and aVF as well as large positive precordial leads, indicating the net QRS vector is directed inferiorly and rightward of the left-sided leads rather than up toward aVR; because lead I and aVF are both positive the frontal plane vector lies in the normal quadrant (0° to +90°), so there is no left or right axis deviation. Final answer: Normal axis.
