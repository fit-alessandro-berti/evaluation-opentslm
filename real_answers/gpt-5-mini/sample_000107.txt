The available recording contains only a very brief segment of usable signal (~0–0.11 s) followed by essentially flat/zero data for the remainder, with documented baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and a pacemaker present, so the tracing is severely limited for rhythm analysis; atrial fibrillation diagnosis relies on the absence of organized P waves and an irregularly irregular R–R interval with fibrillatory baseline on multiple consecutive beats, but here there are at most one or two apparent complexes in the short, noisy window and no continuous series of QRS complexes or discernible P/fibrillatory waves to assess regularity or atrial activity, and pacemaker activity and extra beats further confound interpretation. Final answer: Cannot confirm atrial fibrillation from this ECG (insufficient/poor-quality recording; AF is not clearly demonstrated).
