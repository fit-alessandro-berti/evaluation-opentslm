The recorded traces show normal-looking variability only in the very first ~120 ms with abrupt, large, synchronized nonphysiologic deflections (for example marked negative excursions around 0.08â€“0.11 s present across many leads) followed immediately by a long stretch of constant zero values (data dropout/flatline) and overall baseline instability; these abrupt, short-duration, high-amplitude, simultaneous disturbances across leads that do not follow physiologic QRS/T morphology and occur in brief bursts are consistent with artifact rather than cardiac activity, supporting the presence of burst-type noise superimposed on the recording. Final answer: Yes.
