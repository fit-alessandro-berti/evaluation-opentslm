The tracing in lead aVL begins with a small positive deflection at ~0.02–0.03 s followed by a rapid, larger negative excursion peaking around 0.08–0.10 s; the negative deflection is the dominant component (peak ~‑0.47 units) and the negative deflection and subsequent return toward baseline extend for roughly 60–80 ms overall, consistent with a relatively narrow QRS that lacks a sustained positive R wave in this lead; there is no clear ST elevation and the terminal portion after the main negative QRS remains below baseline suggesting T-wave inversion or ST/T depression in this lead, although baseline drift and noise and the short sample make precise measurement difficult. Final answer: lead aVL shows an rS/QS-type morphology with a predominantly negative QRS (deep S) and associated T-wave inversion (predominantly negative complex).
