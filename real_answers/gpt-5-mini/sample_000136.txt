The trace is heavily degraded by baseline wander and multiple artifacts and only a very brief portion (about the first 0.12 s) contains usable waveforms, but in that segment there are abrupt, high‑amplitude, very sharp deflections followed by large, broad polarity changes especially in the precordial leads; limb leads show near‑simultaneous large negative transients at ~0.01–0.03 s and tall positive deflections in V4–V6 at ~0.00–0.04 s, a pattern more consistent with electrically generated pacing artifacts and consequent wide, abnormal ventricular complexes than with clean intrinsic narrow QRS morphology, and the recording notes “pacemaker present” and “extra beats detected,” so although noise and electrode artifact limit precise interval measurements, the morphology argues for paced ventricular complexes with intermittent premature ventricular‑type beats. Final answer: ventricular paced rhythm (pacemaker spikes with paced ventricular complexes), with intermittent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).
