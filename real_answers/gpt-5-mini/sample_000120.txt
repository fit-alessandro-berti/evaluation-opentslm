The recording is noisy with baseline drift, artifact and evidence of pacing/extra beats which limits precise automated measurements, so I evaluated frontal plane lead polarities to estimate the QRS axis: the limb leads (particularly I and II) show predominantly positive QRS deflections and the inferior leads (II and aVF) are also positive, consistent with an axis directed to the left/inferior quadrant rather than rightward, and the precordial leads demonstrate expected R-wave progression rather than a pattern suggesting marked rightward displacement; although noise and pacing spikes reduce confidence in exact degree, the overall limb-lead polarity pattern argues against a right axis deviation. Final answer: No â€” this ECG does not show right axis deviation.
