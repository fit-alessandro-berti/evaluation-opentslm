The trace in lead aVF shows an initial modest negative baseline, a very small initial r-type deflection around 0.02–0.03 s followed by a more prominent positive deflection (~+1.03 at 0.03 s) and then a deep negative deflection (S/terminal negativity reaching about −1.21 at 0.08 s), consistent with a QRS complex that is overall dominated by a terminal negative deflection (an rS/ QS-type morphology) rather than an isolated large R; the post‑QRS portion shows a small upright repolarization wave (~+0.23 at 0.11 s) without clear ST elevation, although baseline wander and multiple artifacts (and truncated/zeroed data beyond 0.12 s) limit precise ST/T assessment and no discrete pacemaker spike is obvious on this lead. Final answer: predominantly negative QRS (rS/QS morphology) in aVF.
