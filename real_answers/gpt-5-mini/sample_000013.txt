The available recording is very limited and of poor quality: there is baseline wander, static and burst noise and electrode artifact noted, a pacemaker is present and only the first ~0.12 seconds of the trace contain discernible cardiac waveform data while the remainder of the file is zeroed out, so assessment is severely constrained. In the brief visible segment the precordial leads show an early large positive deflection (prominent R waves) followed by negative return toward baseline, but there are no clearly defined, contiguous pathologic Q waves (defined as a Q or QS complex of >40 ms or Q amplitude >25% of the R wave) visible across leads, no sustained ST-segment elevation or depression in the captured samples, and no reproducible T-wave inversion pattern that could be reliably interpreted; pacemaker activity and the noise may obscure small Q waves or chronic changes. Given the extremely limited duration of analyzable signal and the artefactual/pacing confounders, there is no definitive electrocardiographic evidence of an old myocardial infarction in this tracing. Final answer: No.
