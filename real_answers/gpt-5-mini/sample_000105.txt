The recording is noisy and limited (many artifacts and a pacemaker spike pattern complicate interpretation), but examining the single clear beat there are prominent initial negative deflections in several precordial leads followed by a dominant monophasic ventricular complex and no consistent, sustained ST‑segment elevation or sharply peaked hyperacute T waves; the pattern is more compatible with established pathological Q‑type deflections and loss of normal R‑wave progression rather than the acute ST elevation/hyperacute T‑wave picture of an ongoing infarct. Given the presence of fixed Q‑like initial deflections, absence of clear acute ST elevation, and overall paced/abnormal QRS morphology, this ECG is most consistent with an old (chronic, healed) infarction.
