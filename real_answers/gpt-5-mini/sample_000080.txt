On inspection of the raw lead II trace I first identify a positive R‑wave around 0.02–0.03 s (peak ≈ +0.99 mV) followed by a deep S‑deflection at 0.04 s (≈ −1.12 mV) consistent with the QRS complex, and then examine the post‑QRS segment for the T‑wave: between about 0.05–0.07 s there is a small positive excursion (≈ +0.35 to +0.79 mV) but from 0.08–0.11 s the waveform is predominantly negative (down to ≈ −0.86 mV) indicating a terminal negative deflection after the QRS; this pattern is most consistent with a biphasic to predominantly inverted T‑wave in lead II rather than a simple upright T. Interpretation is limited by very poor signal quality (baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact), a very short nonzero recording window, and the note of a pacemaker and extra beats which can distort morphology, so the finding should be confirmed on a cleaner, longer 12‑lead strip; however, based on the available lead II segment the T‑wave is inverted. Answer: Yes.
