The recorded traces show a brief period of clear, synchronous deflections across leads in the first ~0.00–0.11 s consistent with physiological QRS/ECG morphology and then an abrupt and sustained transition to exact zero values for essentially the remainder of the recording, which is most consistent with signal dropout or lead/equipment failure rather than intermittent high‑frequency interference; within the initial nonzero segment there is some baseline variability (baseline drift) and abrupt amplitude changes that could reflect electrode artifact or burst noise, but I do not see the diffuse, high‑frequency, random grainy oscillations typical of static (electrical) noise throughout the tracing — instead there is a near‑complete loss of signal after 0.12 s. No.
