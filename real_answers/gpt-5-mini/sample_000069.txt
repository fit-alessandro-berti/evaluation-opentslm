The provided recording is noisy and truncated but shows brief multi-lead QRS complexes with baseline wander, artifact and a pacemaker present which can alter QRS/ST-T morphology; examining the waveform snippets, there are prominent initial negative deflections in several leads followed by upright R waves and no clear sustained ST-segment elevation above the presumed baseline nor hyperacute T-wave changes that would indicate an acute evolving infarct; instead the pattern is more consistent with residual Q‑type deflections and secondary T‑wave changes that suggest a prior (healed) event rather than ongoing ST-elevation ischemia. Final answer: old (healed) myocardial infarction.
