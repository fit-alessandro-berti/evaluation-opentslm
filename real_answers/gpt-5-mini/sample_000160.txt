The tracing shows a very short active segment from 0.00–0.11 s with abrupt, nonphysiologic, high-amplitude and high-frequency fluctuations across multiple leads followed by an abrupt cessation to flat zero values from 0.12 s onward, which indicates a major recording artifact/data dropout; lead V3 in that active window demonstrates rapid, irregular deflections that do not follow the expected, temporally consistent QRS–T morphology or axis seen in other leads and are temporally sporadic rather than organized cardiac complexes, all of which is characteristic of transient burst noise rather than true cardiac activity. Yes.
