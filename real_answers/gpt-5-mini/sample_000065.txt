On review of the provided time series (100 Hz, intended 10 s) the meaningful waveform is confined to only the first ~0.12 s with essentially flat/zero values for the remainder of the recording, which immediately raises concern for a technical problem (truncated file, lead disconnection or acquisition failure). Within the brief nonzero segment the limb leads (I and II) are nearly identical and many leads show similar simultaneous deflections, which can reflect derived/duplicated channels or malpositioned/incorrectly connected electrodes rather than true 12‑lead morphology; there is a large, brief positive deflection around 0.06–0.07 s but no clear, reproducible sequence of P wave → PR interval → narrow QRS → ST/T wave across multiple beats to allow interval measurement, and the log notes baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact which would further distort morphology and hide pacing spikes; although a pacemaker is reported, no discrete, reliable pacing artifacts or consistent paced QRS complexes can be confidently identified on the trace, and the annotation of “extra beats” cannot be confirmed because there are essentially no successive cardiac cycles to assess rate, rhythm regularity, QRS duration or QT. Because the recording is technically inadequate and shows artifact/limited data preventing standard interval or rhythm analysis, it cannot be interpreted as a normal ECG — No.
