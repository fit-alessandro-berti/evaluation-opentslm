Examining the waveform segment available without presupposition, the tracing shows relatively large QRS voltages across multiple leads in the early samples (notably appreciable positive deflections in the precordial and limb leads) with no clear, well-formed pathological Q waves or convincing localized ST-segment elevations in the readable window; the recording quality is degraded (baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact) and a pacemaker is noted which can alter QRS morphology and obscure ischemic ST/T changes, so localization of acute infarction is not reliable here; acute MI would typically demonstrate new, regional ST elevation or reciprocal changes and/or development of deep Q waves in a territory, findings that are not clearly present in the available data, whereas the most striking reproducible feature is increased QRS amplitude consistent with increased muscle mass or voltage criteria for hypertrophy (acknowledging pacemaker and noise as confounders).
