The lead V6 trace initially shows rapid, irregular swings in amplitude over the first ~0.12 s with abrupt large positive and negative deflections and low-frequency shifts, then it abruptly becomes a flat zero baseline for the remainder of the recording, which is most consistent with a loss of electrode contact (lead‑off) producing an electrode artifact/flatline; the brief, high‑amplitude, nonphysiologic fluctuations before the flatline are suggestive of burst/static noise and the low‑frequency shifts represent baseline drift. Final answer: electrode artifact (lead‑off/flatline) with associated burst/static noise.
