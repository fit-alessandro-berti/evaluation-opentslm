The recorded time series shows several normal-looking beat-to-beat deflections in the first ~0.12 s across multiple leads with clear rapid changes consistent with QRS/T activity, followed by an abrupt and sustained loss of signal (all leads at exactly zero) for the remainder of the recording; there is no slow, low-frequency wandering of the baseline or progressive shift of the isoelectric line that would characterize baseline drift, nor is there a gradual change in amplitude or morphology â€” instead the artifact is sudden and discrete, consistent with a transient loss or interruption (a burst-type artifact) rather than baseline wander. Final answer: burst noise.
