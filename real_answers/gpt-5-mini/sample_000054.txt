The tracings show only a very short nonzero segment (~0–0.11 s) followed by flat/missing data for the rest of the recording, with baseline drift, noise and electrode/pacemaker artifacts noted; within the available segment there are high-frequency/paced spikes and rapid small deflections that cannot be unambiguously identified as two separate intrinsic QRS complexes for reliable interval measurement, but the presence of a pacemaker and “extra beats detected” suggests a paced, regular rhythm at a typical pacing rate rather than an extremely short RR; given the recording limitations and the likelihood of a paced rate in the physiologic range, the RR interval falls in the 600–1000 ms range.
