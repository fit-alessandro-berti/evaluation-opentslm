The provided time series shows only a very brief segment of physiologic-looking signal (approximately 0–0.11 s, 11 samples at 100 Hz) followed by a complete flatline of zero values for the remainder of the recording, and the traces contain large abrupt deflections in some precordial leads and irregular baseline behaviour consistent with the noted baseline drift, static/burst noise, electrode artifact and pacemaker activity; because extrasystole diagnosis requires recognition of discrete premature beats (premature QRS complexes with altered morphology and a change in the RR interval often followed by a compensatory pause) across consecutive leads and interval measurements, the available data do not show identifiable, successive cardiac cycles, P waves, QRS complexes or RR intervals to allow detection of premature beats, and the observed early high-amplitude deflections are more consistent with pacing artifacts or noise than with clearly defined premature ventricular or supraventricular complexes; therefore extrasystoles cannot be reliably confirmed on this recording. Final answer: No—extrasystoles are not reliably identified (indeterminate due to artifact and truncated signal).
