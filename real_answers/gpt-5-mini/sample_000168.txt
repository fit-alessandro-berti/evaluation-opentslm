The recorded tracings show a paced, noisy signal with baseline wander and artifact that limits precise interval measurement, but the primary QRS/ST morphology present in the clearer early samples demonstrates large R-wave/QRS deflections in the lateral/inferior distribution (leads I, aVL, V5–V6 and the inferior leads II, III, aVF) with apparent ST elevation in those leads and reciprocal ST depression in the anterior leads (V1–V3); there are no isolated anterior lead ST elevations or new significant T-wave inversions confined to V1–V4 that would point to an anterior ischemic pattern, and the presence of pacing spikes and a widened/altered QRS does complicate interpretation but the pattern of ST shifts is most consistent with injury in the inferolateral territory. Final answer: myocardial infarction in inferolateral leads.
