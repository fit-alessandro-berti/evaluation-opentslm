The lead V6 trace shows a normal-looking cardiac waveform during the first ~0.00–0.11 s with clear QRS-like deflections and then an abrupt, near-instantaneous transition to a flat, zero-valued signal for the remainder of the recording, indicating a sudden, discrete loss/disturbance of the signal rather than a continuous, low-amplitude contamination; static noise would be expected to produce ongoing baseline wander or continuous high-frequency contamination throughout the strip, whereas this abrupt, intermittent episode affecting V6 (and other leads) is characteristic of a transient artifact/burst event — burst noise.
