The lead I trace is noisy with baseline wander and electrode artifact, showing only an initial brief sequence of deflections before the signal drops to zero (recording clipping/artifact), so interpretation is limited; within the usable segment there is no clear distinct P wave preceding the large rapid upstroke, small low-amplitude oscillations occur early (0.00â€“0.06 s) followed by a sharp rise beginning ~0.07 s that culminates in a large monophasic positive deflection peaking at ~1.5 mV by ~0.11 s, consistent with an electrically triggered ventricular complex rather than a normal narrow QRS, and given the clinical note of a pacemaker and the abrupt high-amplitude onset, this pattern is most consistent with a pacemaker spike followed by a paced ventricular complex in lead I. Final answer: paced (ventricular) complexes / pacemaker spike with paced QRS in lead I.
