On inspection of the raw time series (first ~0.12 s contains the only nonzero signal), several channels show physiologic-looking gradual deflections (leads III, aVL, aVF and the precordial leads) while two limb leads display abrupt, large-amplitude, high-frequency sample-to-sample jumps that are identical to each other throughout the noisy segment, a pattern inconsistent with real cardiac electrical activity and classic for static (electromagnetic/electrode) interference; therefore the leads with static noise are I and II.
