The recording shows a brief, abrupt, high-amplitude, multi-lead disturbance early in the trace (around 0.08–0.11 s) with large, rapidly changing deflections that occur simultaneously across all measured leads and then an immediate change to near-zero values for the remainder of the file; these features are not consistent with physiologic QRS/T morphology or with isolated ectopy but are characteristic of an external artifact burst — a short-duration, high-amplitude, noncardiac signal affecting all channels at once (likely electrode/cable interference or device noise) rather than true cardiac electrical activity, and the very abrupt onset and offset and short time scale fit the concept of burst noise. Answer: Yes.
