The tracing shows an isolated early, large-amplitude, and morphologically bizarre ventricular complex compared with the preceding baseline beats: the extra beat occurs prematurely, there is no clear preceding P-wave that would indicate atrial origin, the QRS-like deflection in the precordial leads is markedly different in shape and larger in amplitude than the prior complexes and appears broad with discordant STâ€“T following it, and there is no visible narrow, normal-conducted QRS following a preceding abnormal P that would suggest a supraventricular premature beat; although a pacemaker is noted in the record, no discrete pacing spike is seen immediately before the extra complex, making a paced beat unlikely. Taken together these findings are most consistent with a premature ventricular contraction (PVC).
