The tracing is limited and artifacted: there is baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact noted and a pacemaker is present, and the numeric waveform after ~0.12 s is zeroed out so only the very early portion of a beat (roughly the QRS region) is available at 100 Hz; the T wave and the latter part of ventricular repolarization (which define the QT interval) are not present for measurement, and pacemaker spikes and noise further confound interval delineation, so it is not possible to reliably measure or correct the QT from this recording â€” therefore I cannot determine that the QT falls above the normal range.
