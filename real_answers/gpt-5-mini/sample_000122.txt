Examining the time series limb-lead signals without presuming a diagnosis, the recorded beats (noting substantial baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artefact and the documented pacemaker) show predominantly positive QRS deflections in lead I (e.g. ≈ +2.8–3.5 mV) and in aVF (≈ +1.7 mV) and broadly positive signals in II/III and the precordial leads during the sampled complex; physiologically this pattern (I positive and aVF positive) localizes the frontal plane QRS axis to the 0° to +90° range (normal to rightward, not in the “northwest” quadrant), whereas extreme (so-called “northwest”) axis deviation would be expected with marked negativity in both lead I and aVF (or I negative and aVF negative/-90° to ±180°). Given the presence of pacing and substantial signal artefact that can alter morphologies, the tracing is somewhat limited, but the observed limb-lead polarities are not consistent with extreme axis deviation. Final answer: No.
