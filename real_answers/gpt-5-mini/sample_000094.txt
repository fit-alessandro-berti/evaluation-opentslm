The recorded 12‑lead tracing contains only a brief nonzero segment in the first ~120 ms followed by a long period of flat/zero signals and multiple signal‑quality warnings, so interpretation is limited; within the initial segment there is a very sharp initial positive deflection followed almost immediately by a large negative deflection and then a secondary positive component across limb leads (I and II show nearly identical morphology), a pattern most consistent with an implanted pacemaker delivering a stimulus with subsequent paced ventricular activation rather than a normal sinus QRS, and the recording metadata and visible disturbances (baseline wander, static/burst noise, electrode artifact) further degrade fidelity while the device/algorithm also flagged extra beats during the capture. Final answer: Ventricular paced rhythm (pacemaker present) and extra‑systolic/extra beats recorded.
