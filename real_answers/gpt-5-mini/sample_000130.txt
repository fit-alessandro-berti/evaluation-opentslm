The recorded trace in lead II shows an initial brief period of physiologic-appearing oscillations with superimposed rapid, irregular high-frequency fluctuations followed very shortly by an abrupt transition to a sustained zero signal across the recording (a sudden flatline), which indicates a transient loss of electrode contact; the early segment also demonstrates low-frequency baseline shifts and intermittent episodes of increased high-frequency disturbance rather than a stable clean waveform, suggesting baseline wander plus superimposed static/high-frequency noise and short bursts of noise. Final answer: baseline drift (wander), static (high‑frequency) noise, burst noise (intermittent), and an electrode artifact/lead‑off (sudden flatline).
