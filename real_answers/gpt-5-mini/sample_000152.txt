The recording shows a normal-looking multi-lead waveform only in the first ~0.11–0.12 s with consistent morphology across leads, followed by an abrupt and complete loss of signal with all channels flatlining at zero for the remainder of the trace; this sudden, sustained disappearance of recorded voltage across every lead is characteristic of lead disconnection/ electrode or cable failure (or recorder channel dropout) rather than static or high-frequency interference, which would produce irregular, noisy, or oscillatory waveforms rather than a persistent flatline; baseline drift or intermittent burst noise would also look different (wandering baseline or bursts of high-frequency artifact), so the pattern here indicates electrode problems (lead‑off).
