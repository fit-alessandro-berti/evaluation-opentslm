On inspection of the raw time series the tracings show marked low‑frequency baseline wander and large amplitude wandering across the initial captured segment (0.00–0.11 s) with values moving from positive to strongly negative levels by 0.11 s and then an abrupt section of zeros thereafter (suggesting loss of signal or recording truncation); this slow undulating shift is seen in the limb leads (I, II, III and the augmented leads aVR, aVL, aVF) where the baseline falls progressively into negative values, and in the precordial leads (V1–V6) which likewise show a progressive downward trend rather than a stable isoelectric line, making P‑QRS‑T morphology and interval measurement unreliable in this recording and potentially confounding interpretation especially in the context of documented electrode artifact, static/burst noise and a pacemaker. Leads showing baseline drift: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6.
