The recording shows normal-looking multi-lead cardiac waveform activity only in the first ~0.12 seconds with clear QRS‑like deflections and voltages that are coherent across leads, then an abrupt, sustained transition to absolute zero values across all leads for the remainder of the trace; burst noise is typically characterized by short, intermittent high‑frequency spikes or transient noisy segments superimposed on the ECG signal rather than a persistent total signal dropout, and I do not see repeated brief noisy bursts or high‑frequency artifact within the active portion of the trace that would fit that pattern—instead this looks like a sudden signal loss or lead/equipment failure producing a flat zero baseline rather than episodic burst noise. Final answer: No.
