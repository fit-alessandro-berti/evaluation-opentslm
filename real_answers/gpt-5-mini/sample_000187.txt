The tracing shows only a very brief nonzero segment in the first ~120 ms with abrupt large deflections followed by prolonged baseline zeros and multiple recording artifacts, and the morphology within that early window is more consistent with pacing/artefactual spikes and abnormal ventricular activation than with clear ST-segment or T‑wave deviations: there is a very sharp, near‑simultaneous positive deflection across leads at ~0.03 s consistent with an external or pacemaker stimulus and subsequent noisy, irregular QRS‑like activity, baseline wander and electrode/static noise that preclude reliable measurement of an isoelectric ST segment or T‑wave polarity; additionally the clinical metadata already indicates a pacemaker and extra beats were detected, which favors an underlying conduction/pacing disturbance rather than a true primary ST/T ischemic change. Conduction disturbance.
