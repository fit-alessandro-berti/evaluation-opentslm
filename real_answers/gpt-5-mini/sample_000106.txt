The available tracing shows only a brief segment of usable signal with significant baseline drift, noise and electrode artefact and evidence of pacing, which limits precise interval measurement, but the single dominant complex present has a broadened, paced-looking QRS with subsequent prolonged repolarization changes rather than the sharp, short T-wave expected with a normal QT; given the paced/wide QRS morphology (which itself lengthens the apparent QT), the presence of artefact and extra beats that make accurate fiducial point detection difficult, and the limited 100 Hz sampling resolution (â‰ˆ10 ms steps) that tends to underestimate short intervals but will still show clearly prolonged repolarization when present, the overall pattern is most consistent with a QTc that is prolonged. Final answer: above the normal range.
