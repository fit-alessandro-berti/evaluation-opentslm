The short segment of usable ECG data contains only a single clearly observable QRS-like waveform (a relatively large positive deflection in the limb leads around 0.06â€“0.07 s) with no preceding or immediately following ectopic complexes, and the trace is otherwise dominated by baseline drift, noise, electrode artifact and an extended period of zero-valued samples indicating missing or clipped data; at 100 Hz sampling very narrow pacemaker spikes can be missed and P-wave morphology and PR intervals cannot be reliably assessed from the available samples, so there is no reproducible evidence of premature atrial or ventricular complexes (no early, aberrant QRS morphology or compensatory pause) in the visible portion, but the recording quality and truncation make the tracing non-diagnostic for ectopy. Final answer: No clear extra systoles identified, but the recording is of insufficient quality/length to exclude them confidently.
