The strip shows a single noisy but complete QRS–ST–T sequence with baseline wander and artifact; there is no clear, localized acute convex ST-segment elevation in any contiguous leads that would indicate ongoing transmural injury, nor are there hyperacute, peaked T waves; instead the post‑QRS segments are relatively isoelectric to slightly depressed/flattened and the T waves are not prominently tall (and in some precordial leads appear blunted or inverted relative to the expected pattern), suggesting prior myocardial injury rather than an evolving acute ST‑elevation pattern; additionally, there is evidence of an initial negative deflection preceding the R complex in some leads consistent with a Q‑wave pattern and there is no reciprocal ST elevation or widespread dynamic ST changes that would indicate an early acute infarct. Final answer: old stage of myocardial infarction.
