On inspecting the time series, the tracing shows a brief segment of variable deflections across the 12 leads in the first ~0.11 seconds with sudden, nonphysiologic amplitude changes and some near-identical values across multiple leads, followed immediately by a persistent flatline of zero values for the remainder of the recording, which prevents reliable measurement of QRS/T morphology, PR/QT intervals or rhythm assessment; the initial segment demonstrates abrupt baseline shifts and high-frequency irregularities inconsistent with normal cardiac waveforms, and the widespread identical values and abrupt transition to an all-zero signal are most consistent with electrode/lead artifact or signal dropout rather than a true sustained cardiac electrical silence, making it impossible to distinguish physiologic pacemaker spikes reliably in this record. Yes â€” this ECG tracing contains significant noise and artifact (baseline wander/instability, burst/static noise and electrode/signal dropout).
