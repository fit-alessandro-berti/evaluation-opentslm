The lead I trace in the provided time series is dominated by abrupt, high-amplitude, short-duration deflections and large baseline shifts rather than a clear sequence of P‑wave → QRS → T morphology: within the first 0.11 s there are rapid positive and negative swings (e.g. sharp transients near 0.00–0.04 s and 0.06–0.10 s) and marked baseline instability, after which the record is flat; these findings, together with the clinical note that a pacemaker is present and multiple artifacts were detected, suggest that the apparent sharp, narrow spikes represent pacemaker pacing artifacts and that overall the recording is heavily corrupted by baseline wander/electrode/static noise so that ordinary P‑QRS‑T components are obscured. Final answer: visible pacemaker (pacing) spikes with marked artifact/baseline drift obscuring intrinsic waveform morphology.
