The recorded beat shows a relatively narrow QRS without the characteristic leftward frontal plane axis shift expected with a left anterior fascicular block (LAFB): limb leads I/II/III and aVL/aVF are predominantly positive rather than showing the small q in II/III/aVF with qR in aVL that defines LAFB, and there is no clear, persistent left axis deviation; additionally the QRS morphology does not show the typical small R with deep S in the inferior leads or the typical qR pattern in aVL. Instead, the inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF and the lateral precordial leads V5–V6) demonstrate localized ST‑T waveform abnormalities (flattening/discordant ST segments and T‑wave changes) that are most compatible with ischemic changes in the inferolateral territory. Final answer: ischemic in inferolateral leads.
