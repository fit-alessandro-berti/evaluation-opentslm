The available trace shows measurable voltages in aVR only in the very early samples (0.00–0.11 s) with abrupt large, synchronized deflections across multiple leads (notably at 0.09 s) that are consistent with a pacing artifact or simultaneous lead saturation rather than irregular high‑frequency “static” interference; the aVR waveform otherwise displays low‑frequency baseline wander and physiologic-looking deflections that parallel other leads in morphology and timing, and from 0.12 s onward all channels are flat zeros indicating data dropout rather than persistent noise; therefore there is no clear pattern of high‑frequency, random static noise isolated to lead aVR. Final answer: No.
