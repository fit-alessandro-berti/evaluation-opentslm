The short captured segment of the tracing in lead aVF shows an initial positive deflection (peak ~0.63 at 0.01 s) followed by a small negative deflection (~ -0.25 at 0.03 s) and then low-amplitude positive activity in the presumed ST–T time window (~0.14–0.38 between 0.05–0.09 s), which is consistent with an upright (not inverted) T‑wave; the large negative deflection at 0.11 s appears abrupt and disproportionate (likely a pacemaker artifact/electrode artifact or baseline jump given the report of pacemaker and multiple noise types) rather than a true repolarization T‑wave, and most of the recording after 0.12 s is not available for confirmation, so with the available morphology and acknowledging artifacts and baseline drift there is no clear evidence of inverted T‑waves in lead aVF. Answer: No.
