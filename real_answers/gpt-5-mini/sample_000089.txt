The aVF trace shows clearly delineated cardiac complexes at the start of the recording with sharp QRS‑like deflections (peaks around +1.4 to −1.5) and preserved morphology rather than high‑frequency irregular oscillations; over the few recorded heartbeats the isoelectric level appears to wander slowly (a low‑frequency shift of the baseline) rather than showing rapid, random jitter, and although the signal abruptly becomes zero after ~0.11 s (likely a data dropout/electrode disconnect), the noise seen in the recorded portion is characteristic of baseline wander rather than static noise — baseline drift.
