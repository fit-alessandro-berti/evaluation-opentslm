The recording shows a normal-appearing multi-lead signal for the first ~0.11 seconds with synchronous QRS-like deflections across the limb and precordial leads, followed by an abrupt, simultaneous transition of every channel to an exact flatline (0.00000) from 0.12 s onward; this sudden, concurrent loss of signal across all channels is characteristic of a burst artifact affecting the entire acquisition rather than an isolated lead problem, so the leads with burst noise are I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6.
