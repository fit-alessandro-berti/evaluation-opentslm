The tracing shows noisy/paced signals with artifact, but examining the limb-lead QRS polarities (noting the large negative deflections around the main complex in leads I and the augmented/limb leads and a net negative deflection in aVF) indicates that the mean QRS vector is directed away from both lead I and lead aVF (i.e., both I and aVF are predominantly negative), which is not consistent with normal, left, or simple right axis patterns and instead corresponds to an extreme (northwest) axis deviation. Final answer: extreme right (northwest) axis deviation.
