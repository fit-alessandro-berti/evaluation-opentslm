On close inspection the trace is limited to a very brief interval of usable data in the first ~0.12 seconds and then shows near-complete signal dropout (long runs of zeros) for the remainder of the recording, and the header notes baseline drift, static/burst noise and electrode artifact; within the short initial segment there are low-amplitude deflections across limb and precordial leads but I cannot clearly identify consistent P waves, a distinct narrow QRS complex, J-point or T-wave morphology, nor can I reliably measure PR, QRS or QT intervals because the majority of the recording is missing/flat and the signal is contaminated; the metadata also indicates a pacemaker and that extra beats were detected during the recording, but I cannot definitively characterize those as paced beats versus artifact or confirm ventricular ectopy from these traces alone. Final answer: Yes — abnormal/inconclusive (signal heavily artifacted with pacemaker present and extra beats detected); repeat high-quality 12‑lead ECG is required for diagnostic interpretation.
