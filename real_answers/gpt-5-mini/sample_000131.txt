The recorded tracing shows a single discernible beat at the start of the file with a rapid positive precordial deflection (large R in V3–V6) followed by a prominent, relatively tall and peaked positive repolarization wave in the lateral/precordial leads rather than a characteristic down‑sloping, “scooped” ST segment with flattened or inverted T waves classically described for digitalis effect; intervals (PR, QT) are difficult to measure accurately because the recording is short and there is baseline drift, noise and electrode artifact and the remainder of the file is zeroed, but the morphology that is visible is most consistent with an abnormal T wave (prominent/peaked T‑wave) rather than a digitalis pattern — final answer: T-wave abnormality.
