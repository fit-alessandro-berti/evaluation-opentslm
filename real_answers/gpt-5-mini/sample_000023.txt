The tracing as provided shows only a very brief segment of true waveform (about the first 0.10–0.12 s) with the remainder of the recording essentially flatlined to zero and multiple signal-quality issues (baseline drift, burst/static noise and electrode artifact) so serial atrial activity and beat-to-beat timing cannot be reliably assessed; within the available epoch there are no classic continuous “sawtooth” atrial flutter waves across the leads and no rapid, regular atrial activity at ~250–350/min, and there is insufficient evidence of fixed AV conduction ratios; because the recording does not demonstrate the repetitive sawtooth flutter morphology and instead is nondiagnostic for organized high‑rate atrial activity, the finding is more consistent with sinus rhythm variation (sinus arrhythmia) rather than atrial flutter — final answer: sinus arrhythmia.
