The aVL trace shows rapid, beat‑to‑beat amplitude changes in the very early portion of the recording (large negative deflections at ~0.01 s followed by positive deflections at ~0.03–0.07 s and returning toward baseline by ~0.09–0.11 s) consistent with cardiac complexes and high‑frequency artifact rather than a slow wandering baseline; importantly, at 0.12 s all channels drop to exactly zero and remain flat for the remainder of the recording, indicating abrupt signal loss/electrode artifact rather than gradual baseline wander over seconds. There is no progressive low‑frequency drift of the isoelectric line across multiple seconds in aVL; instead the disturbance is transient rapid deflections and then a recording dropout, which argues against the typical pattern of baseline drift. No.
