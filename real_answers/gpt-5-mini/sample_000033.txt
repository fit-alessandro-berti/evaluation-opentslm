The recording is very noisy and truncated (signals present only in the first ~0.12 s with baseline drift, static and electrode artifacts and a pacemaker noted), which makes precise delineation of a discrete P wave difficult; at 100 Hz sampling the temporal resolution is 10 ms and the visible atrial/early ventricular deflections in leads such as II are confined to roughly the first 100â€“110 ms with no clearly prolonged, biphasic, or broadened atrial waveform separated from the QRS, so any identifiable P component would be brief and within the normal duration range. Final answer: P duration falls in the <=120 ms (normal) range.
