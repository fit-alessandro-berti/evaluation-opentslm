The aVL trace shows brief, large-amplitude, nonspecific deflections early in the recording (sharp large negative then positive swings affecting multiple leads) followed by abrupt loss of signal (a prolonged segment of near-zero values), with smaller low-frequency shifts and superimposed high-frequency irregular fluctuations before the signal dropout; these features are not typical cardiac complexes or paced spikes but instead indicate intermittent high-energy burst noise/static overprint on the baseline, underlying slow baseline wander, and then an electrode/lead-off type artifact producing signal dropout. Final answer: burst noise, static (highâ€‘frequency) noise, baseline drift, and electrode artifacts.
