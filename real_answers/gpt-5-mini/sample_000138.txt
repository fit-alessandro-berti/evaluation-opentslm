The recorded tracings show clear signal quality problems (baseline drift, static and burst noise, electrode artifact) and the waveform data are effectively limited to the first ~0.12 s of the record with the remainder of the file containing zeros, so although there is an early complex present it is impossible to visualize a full QRS-to-T sequence or the end of ventricular repolarization; pacemaker activity and extra beats further confound morphology and interval identification. Because the T wave and its offset are not reliably present or discernible in any lead of this recording and the trace is truncated, the QT interval cannot be measured with confidence. Final answer: QT interval â€” not determinable / not measurable from this ECG.
