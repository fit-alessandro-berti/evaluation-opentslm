The tracing itself contains only a brief segment of physiologic-looking signal in the first ~0.10–0.12 s followed by essentially flat/zero data for the remainder of the recording, and the provided quality annotations note baseline drift, static and burst noise, and electrode artefact; because the waveform is truncated and heavily contaminated I cannot reliably identify P waves, measure PR/QRS/QT intervals, or evaluate ST‑T morphology or conduction/ischemic patterns from this file. The available information that is certain is that a pacemaker is present (noted in the clinical context) and that extra beats were detected during the recording, and that the recording quality is poor with multiple artifacts making the ECG largely uninterpretable. Final answer: pacemaker present; extra beats detected during recording; severe noise/artifact and baseline drift rendering the ECG uninterpretable for other diagnoses.
