The V2 trace begins with a brief sequence of varying voltages resembling the other leads for the first ~0.12 seconds, then abruptly becomes a constant zero-level for the remainder of the recording, which is not physiologic and indicates loss of the true cardiac signal rather than baseline wander; this sudden transition is characteristic of an electrode/lead artifact (lead-off or disconnection) and the short irregular high-amplitude fluctuations at the start are consistent with a brief burst of noise. Final answer: electrode artifact (lead-off/flatline) with a short burst noise at the onset.
